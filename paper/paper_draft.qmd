# Introduction

Climate change is impacting species survival, persistence and ecosystem functioning globally, including coral. Coral reefs are vulnerable to increasing magnitude and variation in environmental stressors such as ocean temperature, acidification and nutrient loading ([@foster2021]; [@gattuso2014]). Mass bleaching and mortality events linked to climate change can cause reef-building coral population declines, possibly leading to long-term and large-scale coral-macroalgae regime shifts (Arif et al. 2022; Wild et al. 2011). Climate impacts on coral reefs are, and will continue to, decrease the ability of coral reefs to provide ecological functions such as benthic habitat and nutrient cycling (Foster & Attrill 2021; Williams & Graham 2019) as well as ecosystem services such as food, protection, tourism and Indigenous cultural value (Eddy et al. 2021; Stoeckl et al. 2021). We aim to assess the impacts of possible climate futures and identify the characteristics of resilient reefs using the latest generation of larval connectivity research with scenario-based population modelling for the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem.

The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the world's largest coral reef ecosystem consisting of thousands of individual reefs. They are interconnected through coral and fish larval dispersal patterns mediated by hydrodynamic, spatial, and ecological processes (Grimaldi et al. 2022). Severe declines in coral cover are projected due to compounding impacts such as ocean warming and acidification, intensification of Tropical Cyclones, and Crown of Thorns Starfish outbreaks (De’ath et al. 2012; Fox-Kemper et al. 2021; Seneviratne et al. 2021; Sweatman et al. 2011; Wolff et al. 2018). Ominously, the 2023-24 Summer mass bleaching event (Cantin et al. 2024) may be signalling a shift towards this reef future.

Environmental abiotic factors influence how reefs will experience climate change pressures, including the spatio-temporal patterns of thermal stress itself, and indirect factors that influence the stress experienced by corals. Environmental factors such as tropical cyclones and wind driven mixing (Lin et al. 2023; McClanahan et al. 2005); currents (Grimaldi et al. 2022) and depth (Álvarez-Noriega et al. 2018; Baird et al. 2018; Smith et al. 2014) can decrease the magnitude of thermal stress corals experience. On the other hand, high light intensity and nutrient levels in the benthic zone can increase coral bleaching (DeCarlo et al. 2020; Higuchi et al. 2015). These environmental factors influence the resilience of reefs to climate change pressures in combination with related biological factors such as larval connectivity and thermal tolerance.

Connectivity in systems such as the GBR is an important contributor to system resilience, as strong connections are required to repopulate locations after disturbance, and drive adaptation to climate pressures (Angeler et al. 2023; Elmhirst et al. 2009; Hock et al. 2017). When populations that are strong larval suppliers to external reefs are impacted by disturbances, increased adult coral mortality will cause decreased outgoing larvae in the following years. Weaker larval connections then slow the recovery of the externally connected locations (Figueiredo et al. 2022; Hock et al. 2017; Munday et al. 2009). Populations with greater strength and number of outgoing than incoming larval connections - herein referred to as larval sources - have lower resilience to pressures than populations with greater incoming than outgoing larval flows - referred to as larval sinks - as larval source populations lack external sources of larvae that are important in contributing to reef recovery and recruitment of juveniles after disturbances to existing populations (Ani et al. 2024; Hock et al. 2017). Larval source populations are an important component of overall reef resilience as they can contribute larvae to recovering populations at other locations (Hock et al. 2017; Thomas et al. 2015). Connectivity will be altered by future climate change impacts such as population fragmentation, increasing larval mortality, and changes to coastal hydrodynamics (Figueiredo et al. 2022; Munday et al. 2009), and influences the biology of surrounding reef populations.

Many additional biological factors including coral size (Brandt 2009), taxa (Álvarez-Noriega et al. 2018; McClanahan et al. 2005), and acclimation and inherited thermal tolerance (Humanes et al. 2022; Lachs et al. 2024), influence the outcome of high coral heat stress. It has been shown that corals have the adaptive capacity to develop thermal tolerance levels capable of delaying climate impacts under low emissions scenarios (Bairos-Novak et al. 2021; Humanes et al. 2022).

Incorporating the latest advancements in whole ecosystem larval connectivity modelling and research on the mechanisms behind coral bleaching and thermal adaptation responses into coral population modelling allows us to investigate how these abiotic and biotic factors interact and will influence coral climate change resilience into the future. Improvements in coral reef climate response modelling, including sampling from a range of possible climate futures, allow for fine-scale timeseries analyses of uncertain climate change and ecological scenarios (Bode et al. 2017; Chollett et al. 2022; Donner et al. 2018; Klein et al. 2024; Uusitalo et al. 2015).

It is hypothesised that sink reefs are more likely to be resilient under climate change, compared to source reefs, due to greater influx of coral recruits post disturbance. It is hypothesised that reefs with greater depths are more likely to be resilient under future thermal stress, compared to reefs at shallow depths, as they benefit from thermal refugia. It is hypothesised that reef cover will decline by greater magnitude as the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of each Global Climate Model (GCM) increases.

# Methods

## Environmental modelling context

The spatial extent of GBR coral reefs used in this investigation includes 3806 reef areas, as used in ReefMod-GBR (Bozec et al. 2022). Annually and spatially averaged Degree Heating Week (DHW) data is used to represent future thermal stress at each reef location. Five Global Climate Models (GCMs) (EC-Earth3-Veg, ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5, NorESM2-MM and GDFL-CM4) from the Sixth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) were selected for this study. Statistically downscaled 1km resolution Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data for the Great Barrier Reef were obtained from the HighResCoralStress database (Dixon et al. 2023, 2022). Maximum monthly mean DHW levels were calculated from the SST data following NOAA methodology (Liu et al. 2017; Skirving et al. 2020). These GCMs were selected from available GCMs downscaled by Dixon et al. (2023) based on evaluation by Grose et al. (2023), which found high correlation between observed temperature, rainfall, El Niño Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole patterns in the Australian terrestrial region, and the corresponding mechanisms in these GCMs. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is defined, by the IPCC, as the long term warming caused by a doubling of carbon dioxide above its pre-industrial concentration (Forster et al. 2021). The four GCMs span a range of ECS values within the IPCC assessed likely range, and GCM development families, allowing for a range of possible climate futures to be explored, capturing the uncertainty in future responses to CO2 increases (@fig-ecs; Grose et al. 2023; Shepherd et al. 2018). The following analyses are performed using each GCM separately. SSP 2-4.5 is used as a plausible emission pathway under current emission trajectories, with similar atmospheric CO2 levels remaining until 2050 (Hausfather & Peters 2020; IPCC 2023).

## Coral reef ecosystem model - ADRIA x CoralBlox

CoralBlox is a coral population growth and mortality model that simulates groups of corals growing in diameter and competing for limited space over time (CoralBlox citation). This model incorporates linear extension (growth) and background mortality rates that are dependent on the size and functional group of a coral colony. Environmental disturbances and reproduction are not directly considered within CoralBlox. Instead, these factors are considered by making changes to the distribution of colonies within CoralBlox timesteps using the ADRIA (Adaptive Dynamic Reef Intervention Algorithms) platform (ADRIA citation). Within ADRIA, we incorporate coral life history and environmental events in the following order: coral colony growth; coral reproduction; larval connectivity and settlement; and coral bleaching due to heat stress.

CoralBlox uses user-defined size classes that influence size-dependent growth and mortality rates, through which the coral colonies progress as they grow in diameter. Within ADRIA, we define the distributions of these parameters, and the size classes based on ecological monitoring data from the [EcoRRAP program](https://gbrrestoration.org/program/ecorrap/).

Coral fecundity rates are dependent on colony size and functional group following the results of Hall & Hughes (1996). Coral fertilization rates are not considered within this model, however larval survival and viability are incorporated in connectivity modelling (see Connectivity modelling). Viable larvae settle at a reef location and are incorporated into the model as the smallest size class, but are not directly impacted by modelled bleaching mortality as it is assumed the high background mortality of juveniles includes thermal stress.

### Factors influencing bleaching mortality

We track the thermal tolerance of each functional group and size class as a truncated normal distribution that is updated in each timestep following growth and recruitment. This distribution determines that proportion of the population on a reef that is susceptible to bleaching (i.e. has a thermal threshold below the experienced DHW value). Starting distributions for thermal tolerance levels are informed by Bairos-Novak et al. (2021) and unpublished data from Hughes et al. (2018). Tropical cyclones and wave impacts to reefs are not included in this investigation. We scale coral bleaching impacts by a coefficient determined by the median depth of each reef location, following Baird et al. (2018), reducing the proportion of coral colonies on a reef impacted by high heat stress as depth increases. Median depths for each reef location have been extracted from satellite derived bathymetry data for the Great Barrier Reef (GBRMPA 2020). Due to varying degrees of alignment between bathymetry data and the defined outlines for GBR reefs, reefs with less than 5% coverage of valid bathymetry data have been removed from this investigation. Furthermore, reefs that are not allocated to a GBRMPA management area or bioregion have been removed from the investigation, as well as reefs with relative coral cover values greater than five.

## Timeseries analysis

### Reef health metrics

ADRIA output absolute coral cover was used to calculate relative coral cover (relative to initial cover), a reef’s absolute coral cover at each timestep divided by initial coral cover. Initial coral cover is consistent throughout all simulated and GCM scenarios. To limit the influence of reefs with very low initial cover on the results, reefs with future total cover levels that exceed five times their initial cover level were removed from clustering and further analyses. The proportion of each functional group occupying the reef (taxa evenness) was also investigated as a metric for timeseries analysis, but was found to not sufficiently capture the declining condition of reefs suffering from very low absolute coral cover.

### Timeseries clustering

Timeseries analysis is performed by first grouping reefs into three different scales, GBRMPA reefal bioregion, GBRMPA management area and GBR-wide, to investigate the consistency of cluster identification. To identify groups of reefs at each analysis scale that are resilient, intermediate and non-resilient we clustered reef relative coral cover timeseries into three clusters at each scale. To quantify the behaviour of timeseries and identify timeseries that behave similarly we calculate the complexity-invariant distance (CID) between each timeseries. The complexity-invariant distance refers to the Euclidean distance between two timeseries multiplied (corrected) by the ratio of the complexities of the timeseries (Batista et al. 2014). These values create a distance matrix of n \* n dimensions (where n is the number of timeseries in the group) that is clustered using a k-medoids clustering algorithm (Steinmann et al. 2020).

### Further analyses

Reefs in each cluster are compared to identify characteristics that differ between low, medium and high coral cover clusters. These characteristics include reef median depth, mean timeseries DHW, mean timeseries DHW – tolerance level, Pearson’s correlation between total coral cover and inversed DHW timeseries, proportion of coral habitable area occupied by corals in the first timestep, ratio of source-to-sink larval connectivity and total strength of larval connections between reefs. To analyse the DHW - tolerance levels of reefs, heritable DHW – tolerance values were tracked over timeseries in a timestep \* taxa \* reef \* scenario matrix. The mean timeseries was calculated over the first four scenarios for each GCM (four from 4096 scenarios per GCM) due to computational restraints, and then used to calculate an overall mean DHW – tolerance value for each reef under each GCM.

# Results

## Global Climate Model future trajectories

Each GCM shows similar relationships between reefs in clusters of ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ coral cover and contextual analysis factors, thus visual further comparisons of these clusters for each analysis factor are only shown for ACCESS-ESM1-5 GCM (intermediate ECS scenario). Results for the additional GCMs are displayed in the supplementary material. However, there are substantial differences in the longevity of reef resilience and maintenance of coral cover post 2030 between the GCMs, thus relative coral cover timeseries are displayed for each GCM (displayed at management-area scale to preserve coarse spatial differences in coral trajectories) (@fig-gcm-trajectories).

NorESM2-MM has the lowest Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (2.5°C) and reefs exhibit continuing recovery and decline dynamics up to 2074 under this possible climate future. While recovery phases are predominantly seen in the ‘high’ cover cluster, the ‘medium’ cluster, and to a lesser degree the ‘low’ cluster, also exhibit periods of increasing relative coral cover up to 2045. Under NorESM2-MM GCM the Far Northern management area does not see relative coral cover maintenance as high as the three remaining management regions. Under the second lowest ECS projection (GFDL-CM4, 2.9°C) all clusters in each management area exhibit largely declining future trajectories with periods of recovery from 2030 to 2040. ACCESS-ESM1-5 has an intermediate ECS value of 3.87°C which results in intermediate levels of coral cover maintenance (between those of lower and higher ECS GCMs). In all management areas reefs in the high cluster are able to maintain relative coral cover levels to 2050 under ACCESS-ESM1-5. Under ACCESS-CM2 (4.72°C) and EC-Earth3-Veg (4.31°C) GCMs relative cover trajectories are largely declining, with the exception of ‘high/medium’ clusters in the Cairns-Cooktown management area under EC-Earth3-Veg that display prolonged relative cover maintenance.

Across the five GCMs, 50% (1812) of reefs, at management region scale, remain in the same ‘low, medium, high’ cluster assignment. 1757 Reefs (49%) that changed clusters by one level across the GCMs (e.g. a reef is assigned ‘low’ and ‘medium’ in different GCMs), while 46 (1%) reefs changed clusters by two levels across the GCMs (e.g. a reef is assigned ‘low’ and ‘high’ in different GCMs).

## Bioregion scale clustering

Within bioregions timeseries clustering analysis was able to identify three clusters of relative cover timeseries. Across many bioregions timeseries clustering identified a ‘low’ cluster containing reefs that suffer larger declines and generally have lower levels of relative coral cover than the other clusters, a ‘medium’ cluster with intermediate levels of relative coral cover, and a ‘high’ cluster with cover recovery that persists to 2050 in many bioregions (@fig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-timeseries).

In many bioregions, median reef depth decreases as cluster relative coral cover decreases, with reefs within the ‘high’ cluster commonly having the greatest median reef depths within the bioregion (@fig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-depth).

Correlation between reef total coral cover and reef DHW timeseries decreases as cluster relative coral cover decreases, with reefs in the ‘high’ cluster commonly having the greatest total cover – DHW timeseries correlation levels (@fig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-dhwcor).

Conversely, there are no consistent patterns across bioregions in reef relative cover and mean timeseries DHW levels, with clusters having similar mean DHW levels in many bioregions (@fig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-dhwmean).

In some bioregions (4 for ACCESS-ESM1-5) reefs in the ‘low’ cluster have substantially lower mean thermal tolerance levels compared to reefs in other clusters. However, many bioregions do not show strong differences in thermal tolerance levels (@fig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-dhwtol).

In many bioregions reefs with high relative coral cover levels (‘high’ cluster) have the lowest initial proportions of habitable area occupied by corals, while reefs in the ‘low’ cluster often have the highest initial proportions of coral habitable area occupied by corals (@fig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-initialproportion).

Across most bioregions there are not consistent differences between clusters in connectivity metrics such as source-to-sink connectivity ratio (@fig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-logsosi) and total connectivity strength (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-totalconnectivity).

## Management area scale clustering
Within the four management areas, timeseries clustering analysis identified three clusters of reefs using relative coral cover timeseries. These clusters form groups of reefs with ‘low, medium and high’ relative coral cover, categorised by their median coral cover between 2030 and 2040. The ‘high’ cover cluster of reefs contains reefs that have continuing recovery of corals throughout the future climate scenario. The medium and low clusters contain many reefs that decrease to half their initial coral cover levels and largely do not display the levels of recurring recovery that reefs in high clusters experience (@fig-access-esm1-5-manarea-timeseries).

![Reef relative coral cover timeseries clustered within each management area. ‘Low’ clusters (green) are clusters with the lowest median relative cover between 2030 and 2040 within each management area. ‘Medium’ clusters (orange) are clusters with intermediate median relative cover between 2030 and 2040 within each management area. ‘High’ clusters (blue) are clusters with the highest median relative cover between 2030 and 2040 within each management area.

Within each bioregion reef median depth level increases with increasing reef relative coral cover. Reefs in the low cluster have the lowest median depth levels, while reefs in the high cluster have the highest median depth levels within each management area (@fig-access-esm1-5-manarea-depth).

![Median depth for reefs within each management area, separated into clusters assigned by timeseries clustering. ‘Low’ clusters (green) are clusters with the lowest median relative cover between 2030 and 2040 within each management area. ‘Medium’ clusters (orange) are clusters with intermediate median relative cover between 2030 and 2040 within each management area. ‘High’ clusters (blue) are clusters with the highest median relative cover between 2030 and 2040 within each management area.

Correlation between reef total coral cover and the DHW levels they experience throughout the time period increases as coral relative cover increases, with reefs in the high cluster having the highest median total cover – DHW correlation (@fig-access-esm1-5-manarea-dhwcor).

However, reefs with higher relative coral cover levels do not experience lower mean DHW levels throughout their timeseries. There are no consistent substantial differences in mean DHW levels across the identified timeseries clusters (@fig-access-esm1-5-manarea-dhwmean).

## Great Barrier Reef scale clustering
Timeseries clustering identified three clusters in reef relative cover timeseries for the whole GBR scale. A ‘low’ cluster of reefs with little recovery following initial declines, a medium cluster of reefs with median relative cover below 0.5 post 2028, and a high cluster of reefs with median relative cover above 0.5 until 2050 (@fig-access-esm1-5-gbr-timeseries).

The clusters identified with timeseries clustering at the GBR scale show similar patterns to clusters identified at bioregion and management area scales. Reef depth (@fig-access-esm1-5-gbr-depth) and total cover – DHW correlation (@sfig-access-esm1-5-gbr-dhwcor) decrease, while the proportion of coral-habitable area initially occupied by corals increases (@sfig-access-esm1-5-gbr-initialproportion), as the clusters decrease from ‘high’ to ‘low’ cover levels. There are no substantial differences between the clusters in mean DHW (@sfig-access-esm1-5-gbr-dhwmean) and DHW tolerance (@sfig-access-esm1-5-gbr-dhwtol) levels of reefs.

# Discussion
Timeseries analysis has been used to identify three groups of reefs with similar declining (low), recovering (high), and intermediate (medium) coral cover trajectories throughout future scenarios. Throughout all analysis scales, reefs in high cover clusters exhibit spans of recovery up to 2050, while low and medium clusters commonly remain at levels below half their initial cover from 2030. Furthermore, at all analysis scales reef clusters show similar patterns in their reef characteristics such as depth and proportion of habitable area initially occupied.

A key factor that influences the relative coral cover values on a reef is the initial total coral cover used to calculate the metric. This is seen where low and medium reefs have higher proportions of their coral-habitable area occupied by corals initially, while some high-cluster reefs exhibit absolute coral cover levels greater than their initial coral cover, leading to future relative cover values greater than one.

Reefs in different clusters largely do not differ in mean modelled DHW levels experienced, and exhibit overall similar DHW timeseries. While these reefs experience similar magnitude DHWs based on SST, the proportion of the reef’s coral population impacted by heat stress events depends on the depth of the reef. Analysis from Baird et al. (2018) is used to calculate the degree of protection provided to a reef based on the median depth. Our results suggest that within shallow reef ecosystems (depth < 30m), depth contributes greatly to reef resilience and the ability of the reef to recover following heat stress. While similar findings have been demonstrated in the eastern Pacific (Smith et al. 2014), depth refugia analyses have often focussed on the potential of mesophotic reefs (> 30m deep) as thermal refugia (Bongaerts et al. 2010; Holstein et al. 2015; Semmler et al. 2017). In contrast, Venegas et al. (2019) found no association between depth and the alleviation of heat stress across a range of shallow reefs in the Pacific. The depth refugia found on a reef in turn influences the degree of correlation between coral cover timeseries and DHW levels. Reefs in low and medium clusters have lower levels of cover – DHW correlation than those in high clusters, due to their initial sharp declines in coral cover combined with low depth – refugia in the face of persistently high thermal stress these reefs do not recover post 2030, leaving little ability to decline further in periods of high thermal stress and recover in periods of low thermal stress.

Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that reefs at greater depths will experience refugia benefits and more prolonged resilience under climate change compared to shallower reefs. A caveat to these findings is the quality of the bathymetry data used to calculate depth refugia benefits in ADRIA. This data (GBRMPA 2020) is derived from satellite imagery and is limited in its alignment with the established GBRMPA reef outlines used in the investigation to characterise reef locations. As a result, 842 reefs (22% of the 3806) were removed from the analyses before depth comparisons due to having less than 5% coverage of depth data.

Current reef restoration and intervention-investigation efforts on the Great Barrier Reef, such as deployment of coral seeding and fragment devices target reefs with suitable restoration sites in the 1-10m depth range (Howlett et al. 2021; Randall et al. 2021; Whitman et al. 2024). One of the main depth constraints is being able to visually identify the target site from the surface for deployment and ongoing monitoring, in combination with factors such as deployment method and tourism return value. Our results suggest that many reefs with a median depth in this range are likely to fall into the low and medium clusters, suffering large future declines in reef health under climate change and possibly limiting the potential of interventions to deliver recovery in these locations. Reef intervention planning is a complex and challenging decision making process (Anthony et al. 2020), and our results suggest that deployment site depth is likely an important factor to consider when assessing the long-term resilience of reef sites.

Overall, our findings do not suggest that resilient reefs in ‘high’ cover clusters have greater thermal tolerance than reefs in lower coral cover clusters. This is in contrast with literature suggesting corals have the capacity to adapt to increasing climate change pressures (Humanes et al. 2022; Lachs et al. 2024), including the investigation by Bairos-Novak et al. (2021) that revealed high heritability of bleaching and survival response traits used to inform the distributions of thermal tolerance traits used in this investigation. The lack of influence of thermal tolerance on reef outcomes is likely due to reef being impacted by overall similar levels of thermal stress, combined with the greater importance of factors such as reef depth and initial coral cover.

It has been suggested that a primary facet of reef resilience is the degree of larval connectivity between reefs and the supply of recruits that a reef receives following disturbance (Hock et al. 2017). It was expected that resilient reefs would have greater incoming than outgoing larval connectivity to promote recovery in years following thermal stress, while non-resilient reefs would have greater outgoing than incoming connectivity inhibiting recruitment of corals ability post thermal stress. In contrast, our results suggest that there are few differences between resilient and non-resilient reefs in connectivity metrics such as the ratio of outgoing to incoming larval connectivity and total connectivity strength. Hock et al. (2017) used larval connectivity modelling to identify resilient reefs that may supply up to 47% of the wider Great Barrier Reef ecosystem with larvae following disturbance. A criticism of this approach (Bode et al. 2018) is that results obtained are highly sensitive to the biophysical dispersal model used, limiting the application of specific identified reefs. Reef depth was not considered in these investigations of reef network resilience. These investigations were performed using prior generations of larval connectivity models parameterised for 2008-2013 (Hock et al. 2017) and 1996-2002 (Bode et al. 2018) time periods respectively. Using updated 1km resolution larval connectivity across the whole GBR, our results suggest that larval connectivity alone is not as important for reef resilience and recovery as environmental refugia from thermal stress such as environmental refugia factors such as depth.

Five different GCMs were included in analyses to capture uncertainty in climate system responses to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. The large differences in relative cover timeseries seen across the GCMs suggest that it is important to consider this uncertainty in analyses of biological climate change responses. This is supported by recent literature suggesting an effective approach to capturing climate change uncertainty is to model climate change responses using a range of climate models separately (Shepherd et al. 2018). However, the patterns identified between low, medium and high clusters of reefs suggest that the importance of depth refugia is consistent across scenarios. Similarly, at the management area scale, only 1% of reefs were assigned a ‘low’ and ‘high’ cluster in different GCMs, suggesting that intrinsic reef properties can prevent high cover resilient reefs from crashing under a different future climate scenario.

# Conclusions
Overall, our results suggest that when modelled as part of a large and complex ecosystem, reef depth is a key factor contributing to ongoing reef resilience. We provide evidence in support of depth as a form of refugia for shallow reefs. While protecting ‘key node’ reefs in larval connectivity networks is an important consideration for reef restoration efforts (Anthony et al. 2020; Hock et al. 2017), our results suggest that resilient reefs do not have greater incoming or total connectivity to contribute to their resilience. Instead, we suggest that depth, and likely other environmental thermal refugia mechanisms contribute greater to overall reef resilience and recovery. Further investigation could utilise the scenario modelling and dynamic intervention capabilities of the ADRIA platform to explore the effectiveness of prioritising reef depth compared to larval connectivity in reef intervention decision making.
