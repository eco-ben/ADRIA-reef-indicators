    Coral reefs globally face unprecedented threats from climate change, with the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) experiencing severe declines in coral cover from thermal stress events. Understanding which reefs exhibit resilience to climate impacts is critical for conservation planning and intervention strategies. A scenario-based population modelling approach was adopted with larval connectivity dynamics, thermal adaptation, and environmental factors to assess coral reef resilience across GBR locations under future climate projections. Using five Global Climate Models (GCMs) spanning five Equilibrium Climate Sensitivities, three distinct reef trajectories are identified: resilient reefs maintaining coral cover through 2050, intermediate reefs with moderate declines, and vulnerable reefs experiencing severe degradation. Contrary to expectations, larval connectivity patterns did not substantially differentiate resilient from vulnerable reefs. Instead, reef depth emerged as the primary predictor of resilience, with deeper reefs benefiting from thermal refugia that reduced bleaching impacts. Initial coral cover also influenced trajectories, with reefs having lower initial cover showing greater relative resilience. Our findings suggest that depth provides critical protection against thermal stress, contrasting current restoration practices that primarily target easily accessible shallow sites. These results have important implications for reef management, indicating that depth refugia should be prioritized for further consideration in conservation planning alongside connectivity considerations to maximize coral survival under continuing climate change.

# Introduction

Climate change is impacting species survival, persistence and ecosystem functions globally,
including coral reefs. Coral reefs are vulnerable to increasing magnitude and variation in
environmental stressors such as ocean temperature, acidification and nutrient loading
[@foster2021; @gattuso2014]. Mass bleaching and mortality events linked to climate change
can cause reef-building coral population declines, possibly leading to long-term and
large-scale coral-macroalgae regime shifts [@arif2022; @wild2011]. Climate impacts on coral
reefs are, and will continue to, decrease the ability of coral reefs to provide ecological
functions such as benthic habitat and nutrient cycling [@forster2021; @williams2019] as well
as ecosystem services such as food, protection, tourism and Indigenous cultural value
[@eddy2021; @stoeckl2021].

Understanding the characteristics of reefs that will persist under projected climate
conditions requires examining reef resilience across multiple scales and processes.
Structural resilience - the capacity to maintain coral populations and avoid ecosystem
regime shifts - depends on three interconnected mechanisms. First, the ability of individual
corals to survival thermal stress. Second, the connectivity networks that enable
recolonisation after disturbances. Third, the maintenance of carbonate framework that
provides reef structure. We aim to assess how these mechanisms interact under current
projected climate conditions to identify the characteristics of structurally resilient reefs through scenario-based coral population modelling for the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem.

The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the world's largest coral reef ecosystem consisting of
thousands of individual reefs. They are interconnected through coral and fish larval
dispersal patterns mediated by hydrodynamic, spatial, and ecological processes
[@grimaldi2022]. The GBR faces severe projected coral cover declines under climate change [@bozec]. These coral cover declines will be compounded by ocean acidification, intensifying tropical cyclones, and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks
[@death2012; @fox-kemper2021; @seneviratne2021; @sweatman2011; @wolff2018]. The 2023-24
Summer mass bleaching event may be signalling a shift towards this reef future, with some
level of bleaching recorded on 79% of surveyed reefs [@cantin2024].

At the individual coral scale, survival during thermal stress events depends on both
environmental and biological factors. Environmental factors can either amplify or reduce
thermal stress exposure. Depth has been suggested as one crucial factor that can provide
a refuge from thermal stress [@álvarez-noriega2018; @baird2018; @smith2014]. Biological
factors including coral size [@brandt2009], taxa [@álvarez-noriega2018; @mcclanahan2005],
and thermal tolerance through acclimation and inheritance [@humanes2022; @lachs2024] all
influence survival outcomes. Importantly, corals demonstrate adaptive capacity to develop
thermal tolerance that could delay widespread bleaching under moderate emissions scenarios
[@bairos-novak2021; @humanes2022], representing a crucial mechanism for reef persistence.

Beyond individual survival, reef-scale resilience depends on connectivity networks that
enable recolonization after disturbances [@angeler2023; @elmhirst2009; @hock2017]. However,
connectivity creates both strengths and vulnerabilities. Larval source populations that
export more larvae than they import are essential for system-wide recovery, providing larvae
that enable recolonization at distant locations [@hock2017; @thomas2015]. Yet these source
reefs are paradoxically more vulnerable individually, relying heavily on local recruitment
for their own recovery. When disturbances impact major source populations, cascading effects
reduce larval export and slow recovery throughout the connected network [@figueiredo2022;
@hock2017; @munday2009].

Long-term reef viability requires not only coral survival and recolonization, but also
maintenance of the physical reef structure through positive carbonate budgets. Scleractinian
corals build the primary habitat framework, but reef persistence depends on the balance
between carbonate accumulation [@perry2015] and loss through bioerosion, physical damage
[@kenyon], and dissolution [@eyre2014; @eyre2018]. This balance is influenced by coral cover
and complexity [@perry2012; @desbiens], environmental processes, and ocean chemistry
[@perry2015; @eyre2018]. For Great Barrier Reef mid and outer shelf reefs, maintaining
positive carbonate budgets requires approximately 17% live coral cover [@desbiens].

Recent advances in whole-ecosystem larval connectivity modelling and coral thermal response
research enable integrated investigation of how these multiple factors interact to determine
climate resilience. By incorporating the latest coral population models
[@ribeirodealmeida2024], ecosystem-wide connectivity data, and updated climate projections
[@dixon2022], we can examine which factors most strongly influence reef persistence under
different scenarios. While connectivity has been emphasized as critical for GBR resilience
[@hock2017], our integrated modelling reveals that environmental factors - particularly
depth - may play a more fundamental role in determining which reefs maintain viable coral
populations and positive carbonate budgets under projected climate conditions.

# Methods

## Environmental modelling context

The spatial extent of the GBR coral reefs represented in this investigation follows the reef
definitions available via the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority
\[https://geohub-gbrmpa.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/GBRMPA::great-barrier-reef-features-/explore?location=-19.221541%2C145.776418%2C4.94\].
In total this covers 3806 reef areas across the GBR marine park. Annually and spatially
averaged Degree Heating Week (DHW) data were used to represent future thermal stress at each
reef location.

Statistically downscaled 1km resolution Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data for the Great
Barrier Reef were obtained from the HighResCoralStress database [@dixon2022; @dixon].
Maximum monthly mean DHW levels were calculated from the SST data following NOAA methodology
[@liu2017; @skirving2020]. DHWs were represented by a selection of five Global Climate
Models (GCMs) from the Sixth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6;
**citation**). These five GCMs were EC-Earth3-Veg, ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5, NorESM2-MM and
GDFL-CM4, and their inclusion were based on evaluation by Grose et al. [-@grose2023]. Grose
et al. [-@grose2023] found high correlation between observed temperature, rainfall, El Niño
Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole patterns in the Australian terrestrial region,
and the corresponding mechanisms in these GCMs.
<!-- @Ben, the last sentence above is quite long and doesn't explain why the five GCMs
were selected. -->

Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is defined, by the IPCC, as the long term warming
caused by a doubling of carbon dioxide above its pre-industrial concentration
[@forster2021]. The five GCMs span a range of ECS values within the IPCC assessed likely
range, and GCM development families, allowing for a range of possible climate futures to be
explored, capturing the uncertainty in future responses to CO2 increases (@fig-ecs;
[@grose2023; @shepherd2018]). The following analyses were performed using each GCM
separately. SSP 2-4.5 was used as a plausible emission pathway under current emission
trajectories, with similar atmospheric CO2 levels remaining until 2050 [@hausfather2020;
IPCC -@climate2023].

## Coral reef ecosystem model - ADRIA-CoralBlox

CoralBlox is a coral population growth and mortality model that simulates groups of corals
growing in diameter and competing for limited space over time [@ribeirodealmeida2024].
Details on how coral demographic processes are implemented in ADRIA - CoralBlox can be found
in the supplementary material \[**link ADRIA - CoralBlox**\].

### Factors influencing bleaching mortality

In ADRIA we track the thermal tolerance of each functional group and size class as a
truncated normal distribution that is updated in each timestep following growth and
recruitment. This distribution determines that proportion of the population on a reef that
is susceptible to bleaching (i.e. has a thermal threshold below the experienced DHW value).
Starting distributions for thermal tolerance levels are informed by Bairos-Novak et al.
[-@bairos-novak2021].

Tropical cyclones and impact of wave activity to reefs were not included in this
investigation. We scale coral bleaching impacts by a coefficient determined by the median
depth of each reef location, following Baird et al. [@baird2018], reducing the proportion of
coral colonies on a reef impacted by high heat stress as depth increases. Median depths for
each reef location were extracted from satellite derived bathymetry data for the Great
Barrier Reef (GBRMPA [-@gbr10gb2020]) (see discussion for more details). Due to varying
degrees of alignment between bathymetry data and the defined outlines for GBR reefs, reefs
with less than 5% coverage of valid bathymetry data were removed from this investigation.
Furthermore, reefs that were outside the GBRMPA management areas or not associated with a
bioregion were removed from the investigation.

### Connectivity modelling

\*\* need information on GBR1 connectivity used \*\*

## Timeseries analysis

ADRIA-CoralBlox was run for 4096 **sampled** scenarios per GCM. A median absolute coral
cover timeseries for each reef was calculated for each GCM. For timeseries clustering reef
cover timeseries were scaled by the total area of the reef to represent timeseries as a
percentage of the total reef area. The proportion of each functional group occupying the
reef (group evenness) was also investigated as a metric for timeseries analysis, but was
found to not sufficiently capture the declined condition of reefs suffering from very low
absolute coral cover.

### Carbonate budget analysis

Using median coral cover timeseries for each reef we calculated the number of years each
reef maintains coral cover above a given percent threshold. The threshold represents the
level of live coral cover necessary to maintain a positive carbonate budget (denoted here as
$\beta_{0}$ to indicate the budget equilibrium). Greater number of years above $\beta_{0}$
therefore suggests greater resilience and opportunity for recovery.

Recent analyses suggest a general threshold of \~17% live coral cover in the case of the GBR
[@desbiens]. Given in situ carbonate budgets are influenced by (1) a range of processes; (2)
the variety of approaches that could be used to measure those processes; and (3) the
uncertainty surrounding these, it would be unreasonable to assume all reefs adhere to a
single precise $\beta_{0}$ value. Concurrently, it is difficult to ascertain a suitable
$\beta_{0}$ value for each individual reef.

Given the uncertainties present, the proportion of reefs that display capacity to maintain
coral cover above a given $\beta_{0}$ threshold is examined. An indicative range of 10 to
20% is used (inclusive, with a step size of 1%). The range was informed by Perry et al.,
[-@perry2015] and Desbians et al., [-@desbiens] providing plausible indications of the lower
and upper bounds respectively. Robustness of the conclusions drawn to the uncertainty in the
precise value of $\beta_{0}$ for all reefs can then be assessed by using the indicative
range.

The relationship between the number of years above $\beta_{0}$ and median reef depth was
then assessed with Spearman's rank correlation. Spearman's correlation coefficient was
adopted as reef depth and connectivity strength distributions are expected to be non-normal
and highly skewed. Furthermore, reefs are naturally of different types and experience
different conditions, and so the monotonic trends (whether the relationship consistently
increase or decrease) rather than the exact quantative relationship is of interest.

<!-- Split and move below to results/discussion -->

The distribution of number of years above carbonate-cover thresholds is right-skewed, with
many reefs experiencing low numbers of years above thresholds. Similarly, reef median depth
levels and natural log total connectivity strength levels follow right-skewed distributions.
Therefore, we analyse the correlation between number of years above carbonate-cover
thresholds and these characteristics using Spearman's correlation coefficient.

### Timeseries clustering

To identify groups of reefs that are resilient, intermediate, and non-resilient, we
clustered reefs by their temporal behaviour as indicated by their coral cover over time. The
Complexity-Invariant Distance (CID) between each timeseries was calculated to identify
timeseries that behave similarly [@batista2014]. The CID corrects the Euclidean distance
between pairs of timeseries (which accounts for magnitude differences) with the complexity
of each timeseries (obtained through a measure of their variability) to ensure reefs are
clustered based on their underlying temporal dynamics rather than simply their average coral
cover. The process creates a distance matrix of n \* n dimensions (where n is the number of
timeseries in the group) that is clustered using a k-medoids clustering algorithm [cf.
@steinmann2020].

Timeseries clustering analyses were performed at the reefal bioregion scale (defined in
\[https://geohub-gbrmpa.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/GBRMPA::reefal-marine-bioregions/about\]).
Additional analyses were also performed at larger spatial scales, such as the GBRMPA
management regions and whole-of-GBR scale. These were found to lead to identical conclusions
and so are not shown here. Results of these analyses can be found at \[**insert citation for
repository**\] for those interested.

Reefs in each timeseries cluster were compared to identify characteristics that differ
between low, medium and high coral cover clusters. These characteristics include reef median
depth, mean timeseries DHW, mean timeseries DHW – tolerance level, Pearson’s correlation
between total coral cover and inversed DHW timeseries, proportion of coral habitable area
occupied by corals in the first timestep, ratio of source-to-sink larval connectivity and
total strength of larval connections between reefs. To analyse the DHW - tolerance levels of
reefs, heritable DHW – tolerance values were tracked over timeseries in a timestep \* taxa
\* reef \* scenario matrix. The mean timeseries DHW - tolerance was calculated over the
first four scenarios for each GCM (four from 4096 scenarios per GCM) due to computational
restraints, and then used to calculate an overall mean DHW – tolerance value for each reef
under each GCM.

# Results

## Reef carbonate budget

As one might expect, the number of years above $\beta_{0}$ (the assumed positive carbonate
budget threshold) substantially decreases as $\beta_{0}$ increases.

Reefs with greater median depth levels maintain coral cover above indicative carbonate
budget levels for a longer time frame compared to reefs with shallower median depths
[@fig-access-esm1-5-depth-carbonate]. Reef median depth has a moderate positive correlation
with the number of years a reef maintains coral cover above the required threshold
[@fig-access-esm1-5-depth-carbonate]. Depth - carbonate budget maintainence correlation
decreases as the required carbonate budget threshold increases. This is likely due to an
increasing number of reefs being unable to maintain coral cover above threshold levels as
the threshold increases, with values becoming increasingly right-skewed. The natural log of
total connectivity strength was found to have no correlation with the number of years a reef
maintains cover above the required thresholds [@sfig-access-esm1-5-conn-carbonate]. Log
connectivity strength - carbonate budget maintainence correlation slightly decreases as the
required carbonate budget threshold increases.

## Global Climate Model future trajectories

Each GCM shows similar relationships between reefs in clusters of ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’
coral cover and contextual analysis factors, thus further comparisons of these clusters for
each analysis factor are only shown for ACCESS-ESM1-5 (intermediate ECS scenario). Results
for the additional GCMs are displayed in the supplementary material. However, there are
substantial differences in the longevity of reef resilience and maintenance of coral cover
post 2030 between the GCMs, thus coral cover timeseries are displayed for each GCM
(displayed clustered at management-area scale to preserve coarse spatial differences in
coral trajectories) (@fig-gcm-cover-trajectories).

NorESM2-MM has the lowest Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (2.5°C) and reefs exhibit
continuing recovery and decline dynamics up to 2075 under this possible climate future.
While recovery phases are predominantly seen in the ‘high’ cover cluster, the ‘medium’
cluster, and to a lesser degree the ‘low’ cluster, also exhibit periods of recovery and
increasing proportions of coral cover up to 2045. Under NorESM2-MM GCM the Far Northern
management area does not see coral cover maintenance as high as the three remaining
management regions. Under the second lowest ECS projection (GFDL-CM4, 2.9°C) all clusters in
each management area exhibit largely declining future trajectories with periods of recovery
from 2030 to 2040. ACCESS-ESM1-5 has an intermediate ECS value of 3.87°C which results in
intermediate levels of coral cover maintenance (between those of lower and higher ECS GCMs).
In Townsville/Whitsunday and Far Northern management areas reefs in the high cluster are
able to maintain coral cover levels around 20% to 2050 under ACCESS-ESM1-5. Under ACCESS-CM2
(4.72°C) and EC-Earth3-Veg (4.31°C) GCMs cover trajectories are largely declining in all
management areas.

Under each GCM, in all management areas, low, medium and high cluster reefs have low
differences between DHW trajectories (@sfig-gcm-dhw-trajectories). The highest peak DHW
levels occur under GFDL-CM4 between 2045 and 2050, while greater increases in overall DHW
timeseries occur under ACCESS-CM2.

Across the five GCMs, 50% (1812) of reefs, at management region scale, remain in the same
‘low, medium, high’ cluster assignment. 1757 Reefs (49%) that changed clusters by one level
across the GCMs (e.g. a reef is assigned ‘low’ and ‘medium’ in different GCMs), while 46
(1%) reefs changed clusters by two levels across the GCMs (e.g. a reef is assigned ‘low’ and
‘high’ in different GCMs).

## Bioregion scale clustering

Within bioregions timeseries clustering analysis was able to identify three clusters of
area-relative cover timeseries. Across many bioregions timeseries clustering identified a
‘low’ cluster containing reefs that suffer larger declines and generally have lower levels
of coral cover than the other clusters, a ‘medium’ cluster with intermediate levels of coral
cover, and a ‘high’ cluster with greater levels of cover recovery, with persistence to 2050
in some bioregions (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-timeseries;

@sfig-gfdl-cm4-bioregion-timeseries; @sfig-noresm2-mm-bioregion-timeseries).

In many bioregions, median reef depth decreases as cluster coral cover decreases, with reefs
within the ‘high’ cluster commonly having the greatest median reef depths within the
bioregion (@fig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-depth; @sfig-access-cm2-bioregion-depth;

# Discussion

Under all GCMs most reefs are projected to suffer substantial declines in coral cover from
2025 levels. NorESM2-MM and ACCESS-ESM1-5 GCMs convey the most coral cover maintanance into
the future. Differences between low, medium and high reef clusters in cover timeseries are
most notable under these two GCMs. Maintainance of coral cover into the future is not
clearly linked to the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity of each GCM used as ACCESS-ESM1-5 has
a higher ECS value than GFDL-CM4, with reefs experiencing large continuous declines under
GFDL-CM4.

Reefs in different clusters largely do not differ in mean modelled DHW levels experienced,
and exhibit overall similar DHW timeseries. While these reefs experience similar magnitude
DHWs based on SST, the proportion of the reef’s coral population impacted by heat stress
events depends on the depth of the reef. Analysis from Baird et al. [-@baird2018] is used to
calculate the degree of protection provided to a reef based on the median depth. Our results
suggest that within shallow reef ecosystems (depth \< 30m), depth contributes greatly to
reef resilience and the ability of the reef to maintain positive carbonate budgets under
future conditions. While similar findings have been demonstrated in the eastern Pacific
[@smith2014], depth refugia analyses have often focussed on the potential of mesophotic
reefs (\> 30m deep) as thermal refugia [@bongaerts2010; @holstein2015; @semmler2017]. In
contrast, Venegas et al. [-@venegas2019] found no association between depth and the
alleviation of heat stress across a range of shallow reefs in the Pacific. Reefs at shallow
depths experience no, or few, years with coral cover exceeding levels likely required to
maintain positive carbonate budgets. Movement of reefs towards negative cabonate budgets
under increasing future thermal stress over time may contribute to phase shifts in reef
dominant $CaCO_3$ production from coral driven to coralline encrusting algae driven
production, or to bioerosion dominated systems with rapid erosion of physical reef
frameworks [@dudgeon2010; @perry2008].
<!-- The depth refugia found on a reef in turn influences the degree of correlation between coral cover timeseries and DHW levels. Reefs in low and medium clusters have lower levels of cover – DHW correlation than those in high clusters, due to their initial sharp declines in coral cover combined with low depth – refugia in the face of persistently high thermal stress these reefs do not recover post 2030, leaving little ability to decline further in periods of high thermal stress and recover in periods of low thermal stress. -->

Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that reefs at greater depths will experience
refugia benefits and more prolonged resilience under climate change compared to shallower
reefs. Additionally, [-@liu2024] suggest that rubble instability is inversely correlated
with reef depth, possibly limiting the larval recruitment capacity of shallow reefs. A
caveat to these findings is the quality of the bathymetry data used to calculate depth
refugia benefits in ADRIA. This data (GBRMPA [-@gbr10gb2020]) is derived from satellite
imagery and is limited in its alignment with the established GBRMPA reef outlines used in
the investigation to characterise reef locations. As a result, 842 reefs (22% of the 3806)
were removed from the analyses before depth comparisons due to having less than 5% coverage
of depth data. Additionally, deriving estimates of depth from satellite imagery is prone to
high degrees of uncertainty. Data adopted for the given assessment are said to be accurate
up to 15m from Mean Sea Level [@gbr10gb2020]. Furthermore, an estimated median depth is
determined for each reef, using the established GBRMPA reef outlines to provide an
indication of “true” reef extent. Therefore, the estimates of reef depths are taken as a
useful indication rather than an accurate and precise report of reef depths across the GBR.

Current reef restoration and intervention-investigation efforts on the Great Barrier Reef,
such as deployment of coral seeding and fragment devices target reefs with suitable
restoration sites in the 1-10m depth range [@howlett2021; @randall2021; @whitman2024]. One
of the main depth constraints is being able to visually identify the target site from the
surface for deployment and ongoing monitoring, in combination with factors such as
deployment method and tourism return value. Our results suggest that of the reefs analysed
within the 1-10m depth range (1800 reefs) 74% (1328) of reefs fall into the low and medium
clusters (across all GCMs at the GBRMPA management region scale), with many unable to
maintain positive carbonate budgets under future conditions. Reef intervention planning is a
complex and challenging decision making process [@anthony2020], and our results suggest that
deployment site depth is an important factor to consider when assessing the long-term
resilience of reef sites.

Overall, our findings do not suggest that reefs in ‘high’ cover clusters have greater
thermal tolerance than reefs in lower coral cover clusters **need to replot tolerance
values**. This is in contrast with literature suggesting corals have the capacity to adapt
to increasing climate change pressures [@humanes2022; @lachs2024], including the
investigation by Bairos-Novak et al. [-@bairos-novak2021] that revealed high heritability of
bleaching and survival response traits used to inform the distributions of thermal tolerance
traits used in this investigation. The lack of influence of thermal tolerance on reef
outcomes is likely due to reef being impacted by overall similar levels of thermal stress,
combined with the greater importance of factors such as reef depth.

It has been suggested that a primary facet of reef resilience is the degree of larval
connectivity between reefs and the supply of recruits that a reef receives following
disturbance [@hock2017]. It was expected that resilient reefs would have greater incoming
than outgoing larval connectivity to promote recovery in years following thermal stress,
while non-resilient reefs would have greater outgoing than incoming connectivity inhibiting
recruitment of corals ability post thermal stress. In contrast, our results suggest that
there are few differences between resilient and non-resilient reefs in connectivity metrics
such as the ratio of outgoing to incoming larval connectivity and total connectivity
strength. Hock et al. [-@hock2017] used larval connectivity modelling to identify resilient
reefs that may supply up to 47% of the wider Great Barrier Reef ecosystem with larvae
following disturbance. A critique of this approach [@bode2018] is that results obtained are
highly sensitive to the biophysical dispersal model used, limiting the application of
specific identified reefs. Reef depth was not considered in these investigations of reef
network resilience. These investigations were performed using prior generations of larval
connectivity models parameterised for 2008-2013 [@hock2017] and 1996-2002 [@bode2018] time
periods respectively. Using updated 1km resolution larval connectivity across the whole GBR,
our results suggest that larval connectivity alone is not as important for reef resilience
and recovery as environmental refugia from thermal stress such as depth.

Five different GCMs were included in analyses to capture uncertainty in climate system
responses to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. The large differences in cover
timeseries seen across the GCMs suggest that it is important to consider this uncertainty in
analyses of biological climate change responses. This is supported by recent literature
suggesting an effective approach to capturing climate change uncertainty is to model climate
change responses using a range of climate models separately [@shepherd2018]. However, the
patterns identified between low, medium and high clusters of reefs suggest that the
importance of depth refugia is consistent across scenarios. Similarly, at the management
area scale, only 1% of reefs were assigned a ‘low’ and ‘high’ cluster in different GCMs,
suggesting that intrinsic reef properties can prevent high cover resilient reefs from
crashing under a different future climate scenario.

There are multiple caveats in how coral ecosystem dynamics are modelled in this
investigation. We model coral colonies as objects with circular diameter values and track
these diameters over timesteps through growth. Due to the availability of quality future
projected data we do not consider the impacts of waves, cyclones and currents on coral
colony survival and bleaching (insert citations for waves affecting survival and bleaching).
We do not consider the impacts of Crown of Thorns Starfish (CoTS) on coral survival and reef
resilience (insert citation for cots affecting corals). Furthermore, there are multiple
caveats to acknowledge in the data sources used in this investigation. Uncertainty in
connectivity modelling outputs, satellite-derived bathymetry data and future thermal stress
projections are likely to influence the results obtained in this investigation. To limit the
influence of bathymetry data on results, reefs with less than 5% data coverage are removed
from analyses. The DHW data used in this investigation have not been bias corrected for the 
Great Barrier Reef region and is part of a wider Australian dataset [@dixon2022] developed 
using statistical downscaling. We investigate a range of future climate responses and 
thermal projections to account for a range of possible futures, and our results suggest 
the factors that influence reef resilience are consistent across these scenarios.

ADRIA - CoralBlox has not been calibrated or validated at the GBR-wide scale. Accordingly,
the purpose of this investigation is to assess the relative influence of reef
characteristics on future resilience and highlight possible outcomes under highly uncertain
future scenarios, rather than provide spatially explicit predictions of future resilience.

Further analyses could build on the findings of this study by analysing the impacts of
prioritising reef depth in reef restoration intervention decision making. The ADRIA platform
is developed as a modelling tool to incorporate multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and
ecosystem scenario modelling into reef restoration decision analysis. The platform allows
for the investigation of different reef characteristics to be targetted in decision making
and models the evolving outcomes as a result of reef interventions at various locations. The
capability of ADRIA-CoralBlox could be further expanded by incorporating the impacts of
waves, cyclones, CoTS and currents into reef resilience investigations [@lin2023;
@mcclanahan2005; @grimaldi2022; @liu2024]. Additionally, the investigation could be enhanced
by incorporating future ocean acidification into considerations of coral carbonate budgets
required for healthy habitat production.

# Conclusions

Overall, our results suggest that when modelled as part of a large and complex ecosystem,
reef depth is a key factor contributing to ongoing reef resilience. We provide evidence in
support of depth as a form of refugia for shallow reefs. While protecting ‘key node’ reefs
in larval connectivity networks is an important consideration for reef restoration efforts
[@anthony2020; @hock2017], our results suggest that resilient reefs do not have greater
incoming or total connectivity to contribute to their resilience under modelled projected
conditions. Instead, we suggest that depth, and likely other environmental thermal refugia
mechanisms contribute greater to overall reef resilience and recovery. We suggest further
analyses that investigate the benefits of incorporating depth-based resilience into reef
decision making.

## ADRIA - CoralBlox

CoralBlox model incorporates linear extension (growth) and background mortality rates that
are dependent on the size and functional group of a coral colony. Environmental disturbances
and reproduction are not directly considered within CoralBlox. Instead, these factors are
considered by making changes to the distribution of colonies within CoralBlox timesteps
using the ADRIA (Adaptive Dynamic Reef Intervention Algorithms) platform [@iwanaga2023].
Within ADRIA, we incorporate coral life history and environmental events in the following
order: coral colony growth; coral reproduction; larval connectivity and settlement; and
coral bleaching due to heat stress. As ADRIA and CoralBlox are coupled together to represent
the system, we refer to both as ADRIA-CoralBlox.

Coral fecundity rates are dependent on colony size and functional group following the
results of Hall & Hughes [-@hall1996]. Coral fertilization rates are not considered within
this model, however larval survival and viability are incorporated in connectivity modelling
(see Connectivity modelling). Viable larvae settle at a reef location and are incorporated
into the model as the smallest size class but are not directly impacted by modelled
bleaching mortality. There has been contrasting evidence for juvenile corals being immune to
thermal bleaching events [@depczynski2013], we assume the high background mortality of
juveniles includes thermal stress [@álvarez-noriega2018].

### Model parameterisation

CoralBlox uses user-defined size classes that influence size-dependent growth and mortality
rates, through which the coral colonies progress as they grow in diameter. Within ADRIA, we
define the distributions of these parameters, and the size classes based on ecological
monitoring data from the Ecological Intelligence for Reef Restoration Program (EcoRRAP)
([@australianinstituteofmarinescience2025; @ribeirodealmeida2024]).
