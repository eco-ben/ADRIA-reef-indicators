    Coral reefs globally face unprecedented threats from climate change, with the Great Barrier
    Reef (GBR) experiencing severe declines in coral cover from thermal stress events.
    Understanding which reefs exhibit resilience to climate impacts is critical for conservation
    planning and intervention strategies. A scenario-based population modelling approach was
    adopted with larval connectivity dynamics, thermal adaptation, and environmental factors
    to assess coral reef resilience across GBR locations under future climate projections.
    Using five Global Climate Models (GCMs) spanning five Equilibrium Climate Sensitivities,
    we analysed reef cover timeseries and the ability of reefs to maintain positive carbonate
    production budgets under future conditions. Contrary to expectations, larval connectivity
    patterns did not correlate with increases in maintainence of positive carbonate budgets.
    Instead, reef depth emerged as the primary predictor of cover-timeseries resilience and
    maintainence of positive carbonate budgets, with deeper reefs benefiting from thermal
    refugia that reduce bleaching impacts. Our findings suggest that depth provides critical
    protection against thermal stress, contrasting current restoration practices that primarily
    target easily accessible shallow sites. These results have important implications for
    reef management, indicating that depth refugia should be prioritized for further
    consideration in conservation planning alongside connectivity considerations to maximize
    coral survival under continuing climate change.

# Introduction

Climate change is impacting species survival, persistence and ecosystem functions globally,
including coral reefs. Coral reefs are vulnerable to increasing magnitude and variation in
environmental stressors such as ocean temperature, acidification and nutrient loading
[@foster2021; @gattuso2014]. Mass bleaching and mortality events linked to climate change
can cause reef-building coral population declines, possibly leading to long-term and
large-scale coral-macroalgae regime shifts [@arif2022; @wild2011]. Climate impacts on coral
reefs are, and will continue to, decrease the ability of coral reefs to provide ecological
functions such as benthic habitat and nutrient cycling [@forster2021; @williams2019] as well
as ecosystem services such as food, protection, tourism and Indigenous cultural value
[@eddy2021; @stoeckl2021].

Understanding the characteristics of reefs that will persist under projected climate
conditions requires examining reef resilience across multiple scales and processes.
Structural resilience - the capacity to maintain coral populations and avoid ecosystem
regime shifts - depends on three interconnected mechanisms. First, the ability of individual
corals to survive thermal stress. Second, the connectivity networks that enable
recolonisation after disturbances. Third, the maintenance of the carbonate framework that
provides reef structure. We aim to assess how these mechanisms interact under projected
climate conditions to identify the characteristics of structurally resilient reefs through
scenario-based coral population modelling for the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem.

The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the world's largest coral reef ecosystem consisting of
thousands of individual reefs. They are interconnected through coral and fish larval
dispersal patterns mediated by hydrodynamic, spatial, and ecological processes
[@grimaldi2022]. The GBR faces severe projected coral cover declines under climate change
[@bozec2022]. These coral cover declines will be compounded by ocean acidification,
intensifying tropical cyclones, and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks [@death2012;
@fox-kemper2021; @seneviratne2021; @sweatman2011; @wolff2018]. The 2023-24 Summer mass
bleaching event may be signalling a shift towards this reef future, with some level of
bleaching recorded on 79% of surveyed reefs (total 1001 surveyed reefs) [@cantin2024].

At the individual coral scale, survival during thermal stress events depends on both
environmental and biological factors. Environmental factors can either amplify or reduce
thermal stress exposure. Depth has been suggested as one crucial factor that can provide a
refuge from thermal stress [@álvarez-noriega2018; @baird2018; @smith2014]. Biological
factors including coral size [@brandt2009], taxa [@álvarez-noriega2018; @mcclanahan2005],
and thermal tolerance through acclimation and inheritance [@humanes2022; @lachs2024] all
influence survival outcomes. Importantly, corals demonstrate adaptive capacity to develop
thermal tolerance that could delay widespread bleaching under moderate emission scenarios
[@bairos-novak2021; @humanes2022], representing a crucial mechanism for reef persistence.

Beyond individual survival, reef-scale resilience depends on connectivity networks that
enable recolonization after disturbances [@angeler2023; @elmhirst2009; @hock2017]. However,
connectivity creates both strengths and vulnerabilities. Larval source populations that
export more larvae than they import are essential for system-wide recovery, providing larvae
that enable recolonization at distant locations [@hock2017; @thomas2015]. Yet these source
reefs are paradoxically more vulnerable individually, relying heavily on local recruitment
for their own recovery. When disturbances impact major source populations, cascading effects
reduce larval export and slow recovery throughout the connected network [@figueiredo2022;
@hock2017; @munday2009].

Long-term reef viability requires not only coral survival and recolonization, but also
maintenance of the physical reef structure through positive carbonate budgets. Scleractinian
corals build the primary habitat framework, but reef persistence depends on the balance
between carbonate accumulation [@perry2015] and loss through bioerosion, physical damage
[@kenyon2023], and dissolution [@eyre2014; @eyre2018]. This balance is influenced by coral
cover and community complexity [@perry2012; @desbiens2021], environmental processes, and
ocean chemistry [@perry2015; @eyre2018]. For Great Barrier Reef mid and outer shelf reefs,
maintaining positive carbonate budgets requires approximately 17% live coral cover
[@desbiens2021].

Recent advances in whole-ecosystem larval connectivity modelling and coral thermal response
research enable integrated investigation of how these multiple factors interact to determine
climate resilience. By incorporating the latest coral population models
[@ribeirodealmeida2024], ecosystem-wide connectivity data, and updated climate projections
[@dixon2022], we can examine which factors most strongly influence reef persistence under
different scenarios. While connectivity has been emphasized as critical for GBR resilience
[@hock2017], and remains an important consideration, our integrated modelling reveals depth
may play a fundamental role in determining maintenance of reef coral populations and
positive carbonate budgets under current projections of climate change.

# Methods

## Reef representations

The spatial extent of the GBR reefs represented in this investigation follows the reef
definitions available via the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority [@greatba2022]. An
indicative map of the GBR marine park including the Marine Park regions and which bioregion
each reef belongs to is shown in @fig-region-map. In total, the dataset represents 3806 reef
areas across the GBR marine park. Reefs that are outside the GBRMPA management areas or are
not associated with a GBRMPA reefal bioregion **\[TI: Ben, cite the bioregion data
source\]** were removed from the investigation, leaving 3531 reefs. Annually and spatially
averaged Degree Heating Week (DHW) data were used to represent future thermal stress at each
reef location. Code used to calculate DHW data and perform analyses involved in this
investigation can be found at **insert repo citation**.

## Degree Heating Week trajectories

Future projections of maximum yearly Degree Heating Weeks (DHWs) for each reef were
estimated from Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data for the GBR. Statistically downscaled 1km
resolution SST data for five Global Climate Models (GCMs) were obtained from the
HighResCoralStress database [@dixon2022; @dixon2023]. These five GCMs were EC-Earth3-Veg,
ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5, NorESM2-MM and GFDL-CM4 and are a part of the Sixth Phase of the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) based on evaluation conducted by Grose et al.
[-@grose2023]. These GCMs were found to rank highly in the recreation of historical
atmospheric temperature and precipitation conditions in the Australasian region. While this
assessment does not consider oceanic data, Grose et al. [-@grose2023] provide a
region-specific selection mechanism which we use as an indicator of general performance of
GCMs for the region. An overview of the selected GCMs are provided in @tbl-gcms. The process
described herein was conducted for all reefs within the GBR Marine Park to create DHW
projections spanning from 2025 to 2075.

The five selected GCMs span a range of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) values within
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed likely range, and GCM
development families \[**TI: Ben, what does "GCM development families" mean?**\]. The IPCC
defines ECS as the long term warming caused by a doubling of carbon dioxide above its
pre-industrial concentration [@forster2021]. The five GCMs therefore allow for a range of
possible climate futures to be explored, capturing the uncertainty in future responses to
CO2 increases (@fig-ecs; @sfig-methods-dhws; [@grose2023; @shepherd2018]) **\[TI: Missing
figure reference?\]**. Projections using Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5 was used
to represent the plausible emission pathway. It represents a moderate emissions scenario
with continued CO2 emissions comparable to present day until 2050, after which emissions
gradually decline. Under this scenario, atmospheric concentrations approximately reach
540ppm by 2100 [@hausfather2020; IPCC -@climate2023]. The selected GCMs represent 2.5°C to
4.31°C of global atmospheric warming in the 2081-2100 period relative to 1850-1900.

DHW climatological baselines were calculated from the SST data following NOAA methodology
[@liu2017; @skirving2020]. For each pixel of SST data, the Monthly Mean SST climatology was
calculated by computing the mean SST value for each calendar month (January through
December) across the 28-year baseline period from 1985 to 2012. This climatological baseline
was then temporally adjusted to center at year 1988.2857, which represents the midpoint of
the reference period and accounts for any long-term trends within the baseline years
themselves. The adjustment ensures that the climatology represents conditions at a specific
temporal reference point rather than being influenced by gradual warming or cooling trends
that may have occurred during the 1985-2012 period. The resulting monthly climatologies
serve as a standardized reference against which current SST conditions can be compared to
identify thermal anomalies and assess coral bleaching risk, following the methodology
established by Skirving et al. [-@skirving2020].

**\[TI: Ben, could you provide more details in the paragraph above please? What resolution
is the data in? 10m\^2?\]**

Degree Heating Weeks (DHWs) were then derived using the "HotSpot SST Anomaly" approach
[@skirving2020]. The "HotSpot SST Anomaly" represents the thermal stress experienced by
coral reefs and is calculated as the difference between daily SST values and the maximum of
a pixel's monthly mean climatology across all twelve months (i.e., the maximum monthly mean
temperature). This approach uses the annual maximum temperature as the baseline because
corals are adapted to withstand their local warmest conditions under normal seasonal cycles.
When temperatures exceed this seasonal maximum, corals experience thermal stress that can
lead to bleaching. Only positive anomalies are considered relevant for coral stress, as
temperatures below the seasonal maximum do not contribute to bleaching risk.

DHW values on a per-pixel basis were then calculated as the 12-week rolling sum of positive
HotSpot SST Anomaly values, expressed in units of °C-weeks. The 12-week accumulation period
reflects the cumulative nature of coral thermal stress. Brief temperature spikes may be
tolerable, but sustained or repeated exposure to elevated temperatures causes progressively
greater physiological stress and bleaching severity. DHW values integrate both the magnitude
and duration of thermal stress: a moderate anomaly (e.g., 1°C) sustained for 12 weeks
produces the same DHW value as a severe anomaly (e.g., 3°C) lasting 4 weeks, though the
biological impacts may differ. DHW estimates for each indicative reef (see @greatba2022)
were then determined by taking the mean DHW value for all pixels within each reef outline.

**\[TI: Ben, I did my best to expand on DHW calculations and detail HotSpot SST anomaly,
could you please check?\]**

## Depth estimation

Median depths for each reef location were extracted from satellite derived bathymetry data
for the Great Barrier Reef (GBRMPA [-@gbr10gb2020]) (see discussion for more details). Due
to varying degrees of alignment between bathymetry data and the defined outlines for GBR
reefs, reefs with less than 5% coverage of valid bathymetry data were removed from analyses
involving depth as a resilience factor.

\[**TI:** **For Takuya to flesh out**\]

\[Below moved from discussion - to be reworked for flow\]

These data (GBRMPA [-@gbr10gb2020]) are derived from satellite imagery and can be limited in
their alignment with the established GBRMPA reef outlines used in the investigation to
characterise reef locations. As a result, 842 reefs (22% of 3806 reefs) were removed from
the depth-related analyses due to having less than 5% coverage of depth data. **\[TI to BG:
is this number of reefs consistent?\]**

Additionally, deriving estimates of depth from satellite imagery is prone to high degrees of
uncertainty. Data adopted for the given assessment are said to be accurate up to 15m from
Mean Sea Level [@gbr10gb2020]. Furthermore, an estimated median depth is determined for each
reef, using the established GBRMPA reef outlines to provide an indication of “true” reef
extent. Therefore, the estimates of reef depths are taken as a useful indication rather than
an accurate and precise report of reef depths across the GBR.

## ADRIA-CoralBlox modelling

ADRIA.jl is a decision support platform that combines scenario analysis with biotic and
abiotic processes such as bleaching responses, thermal tolerance and flows of larvae between
reefs [@iwanaga2023]. CoralBlox.jl is a coral population growth and mortality model that
simulates groups of corals growing in diameter and competing for limited space over time
[@ribeirodealmeida2024]. We combine these tools to model the populations of corals across
the GBR. Details on how coral demographic processes are implemented in ADRIA - CoralBlox can
be found in the supplementary material.

### Factors influencing bleaching mortality

In ADRIA we track the thermal tolerance of each functional group and size class as a
truncated normal distribution that is updated in each timestep following growth and
recruitment. This distribution determines the proportion of the population on a reef that is
susceptible to bleaching (i.e. has a thermal threshold below the experienced DHW value).
Starting distributions for thermal tolerance levels are informed by Bairos-Novak et al.
[-@bairos-novak2021].

Tropical cyclones and impact of wave activity to reefs were not included in this
investigation. We scale coral bleaching impacts by a coefficient determined by the median
depth of each reef location, following Baird et al. [@baird2018], reducing the proportion of
coral colonies on a reef impacted by high heat stress as depth increases.

### Connectivity modelling

\*\* need information on GBR1 connectivity used \*\*

Connectivity data from 24 days in total were used in this investigation. These data span six
years: 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 are each represented by 3 daily connectivity matrices,
while 2017 and 2020 are each represented by 5 daily matrices. Indicative connectivity
strengths are implemented in ADRIA-CoralBlox as the mean of all available data for each
location (i.e., all 24 days). While the connectivity strengths do not vary from year to year
within the simulation, they do vary between reefs of varying sizes, providing sufficient
heterogeneity to capture spatial patterns in larval dispersal and settlement dynamics. The
spatial variability also enables investigations into the influence of connectivity strength
and its role in driving recovery processes.

## Timeseries analysis

ADRIA-CoralBlox was run for 4096 **sampled** scenarios for each of the five GCMs (20,480
total model runs). A median absolute coral cover timeseries for each reef was calculated for
each GCM. For timeseries clustering reef cover timeseries were scaled by the total area of
the reef to represent cover as a percentage of the total reef area. The proportion of each
functional group occupying the reef (group evenness) was also investigated as a metric for
timeseries analysis, but was found to not sufficiently capture the declined condition of
reefs suffering from very low absolute coral cover.

### Carbonate budget analysis

Using median coral cover timeseries for each reef we calculated the number of years each
reef maintains coral cover above a given percent threshold. The threshold represents the
level of live coral cover necessary to maintain a positive carbonate budget (denoted here as
$\beta_{0}$ to indicate the budget equilibrium). Greater number of years above $\beta_{0}$
therefore suggests greater resilience and opportunity for recovery.

Recent analyses suggest a general threshold of \~17% live coral cover in the case of the GBR
[@desbiens2021]. Given in situ carbonate budgets are influenced by (1) a range of processes;
(2) the variety of approaches that could be used to measure those processes; and (3) the
uncertainty surrounding these, it would be unreasonable to assume all reefs adhere to a
single precise $\beta_{0}$ value. Concurrently, it is difficult to ascertain a suitable
$\beta_{0}$ value for each individual reef.

Given the uncertainties present, the proportion of reefs that display capacity to maintain
coral cover above a given $\beta_{0}$ threshold is examined. An indicative range of 10 to
20% is used (inclusive, with a step size of 1%). The range was informed by Perry et al.,
[-@perry2015] and Desbians et al., [-@desbiens2021] providing plausible indications of the
lower and upper bounds respectively. Robustness of the conclusions drawn to the uncertainty
in the precise value of $\beta_{0}$ for all reefs can then be assessed by using the
indicative range.

The relationship between the number of years above $\beta_{0}$ and median reef depth was
then assessed with Spearman's rank correlation. Spearman's correlation coefficient was
adopted as reef depth and connectivity strength distributions are expected to be non-normal
and highly skewed. Furthermore, reefs are naturally of different types and experience
different conditions, and so the monotonic trends (whether the relationship consistently
increase or decrease) rather than the exact quantative relationship is of interest.

### Timeseries clustering

To identify groups of reefs that are resilient, intermediate, and non-resilient, we
clustered reefs into three clusters based on their temporal behaviour as indicated by coral
cover over time. The Complexity-Invariant Distance (CID) between each timeseries was
calculated to identify timeseries that behave similarly [@batista2014]. The CID corrects the
Euclidean distance between pairs of timeseries (which accounts for magnitude differences)
with the complexity of each timeseries (obtained through a measure of their variability) to
ensure reefs are clustered based on their underlying temporal dynamics rather than simply
their average coral cover. The process creates a distance matrix of n \* n dimensions (where
n is the number of timeseries in the group) that is clustered using a k-medoids clustering
algorithm [cf. @steinmann2020].

Timeseries clustering analyses were performed at the reefal bioregion scale (defined in
\[https://geohub-gbrmpa.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/GBRMPA::reefal-marine-bioregions/about\]).
Additional analyses were also performed at larger spatial scales, such as the GBRMPA
management regions and whole-of-GBR scale. These were found to lead to identical conclusions
and so are not shown here. Results of these analyses can be found at \[**insert citation for
repository**\] for those interested.

Reefs in each timeseries cluster were compared to identify characteristics that differ
between low, medium and high coral cover clusters. These characteristics include reef median
depth, mean timeseries DHW, mean timeseries DHW – tolerance level, Pearson’s correlation
between total coral cover and inversed DHW timeseries, proportion of coral habitable area
occupied by corals in the first timestep, ratio of source-to-sink larval connectivity and
total strength of larval connections between reefs. To analyse the DHW - tolerance levels of
reefs, heritable DHW – tolerance values were tracked over timeseries in a timestep \* taxa
\* reef \* scenario matrix. The mean timeseries DHW - tolerance was calculated over the
first four scenarios for each GCM (four from 4096 scenarios per GCM) due to computational
restraints, and then used to calculate an overall mean DHW – tolerance value for each reef
under each GCM.

# Results

## Reef carbonate budget

As one might expect, the number of years experience cover above $\beta_{0}$ (the assumed
positive carbonate budget threshold) substantially decreases as $\beta_{0}$ increases. The
distribution of number of years above carbonate-cover thresholds is right-skewed, with many
reefs experiencing low numbers of years above thresholds.

Reefs with greater median depth levels maintain coral cover above indicative carbonate
budget levels for a longer time frame compared to reefs with shallower median depths
[@fig-access-esm1-5-depth-carbonate]. Reef median depth has a moderate positive correlation
with the number of years a reef maintains coral cover above the required threshold
[@fig-access-esm1-5-depth-carbonate]. Depth - carbonate budget maintainence correlation
decreases as $\beta_{0}$ increases. This is likely due to an increasing number of reefs
being unable to maintain coral cover above threshold levels as the threshold increases, with
values becoming increasingly right-skewed. The natural log of total connectivity strength
was found to have no correlation with the number of years a reef maintains cover above the
required thresholds [@sfig-access-esm1-5-conn-carbonate]. Log connectivity strength -
carbonate budget maintainence correlation slightly decreases as the required carbonate
budget threshold increases.

## Future DHW trajectories

Each Global Climate Model (GCM) shows similar relationships between reef clusters and
contextual analysis factors, thus further comparisons of these clusters for each analysis
factor are only shown for ACCESS-ESM1-5 (an intermediate Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity
scenario). Results for the additional GCMs are displayed in the supplementary material.
However, there are substantial differences in the longevity of reef resilience and
maintenance of coral cover post 2030 between the GCMs, thus coral cover timeseries are
displayed for each GCM (displayed clustered at management-area scale to preserve coarse
spatial differences in coral trajectories) (@fig-gcm-cover-trajectories).

NorESM2-MM has the lowest Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (2.5°C) and reefs exhibit
continuing recovery and decline dynamics up to 2075 under this possible climate future.
Recovery phases are predominantly seen in the ‘high’ cover cluster. The ‘medium’ cluster,
and to a lesser degree the ‘low’ cluster, also exhibit periods of recovery and increasing
proportions of coral cover up to 2045. Under NorESM2-MM the Far Northern management area
does not see coral cover maintenance as high as the other management regions \[**TI:**
**Quantify this! How did you determine this and how large/small are the difference in coral
cover maintenance?**\]. Under the second lowest ECS projection (GFDL-CM4, 2.9°C) all
clusters in each management area exhibit largely declining future trajectories with periods
of recovery from 2030 to 2040. ACCESS-ESM1-5 has an intermediate ECS value of 3.87°C which
results in intermediate levels of coral cover maintenance (between those of lower and higher
ECS GCMs). In Townsville-Whitsunday and Far Northern management areas, reefs in the high
cluster are able to maintain coral cover levels around 20% to 2050 under ACCESS-ESM1-5.
Under ACCESS-CM2 (4.72°C) and EC-Earth3-Veg (4.31°C) GCMs cover trajectories are largely
declining in all management areas.

Under each GCM, in all management areas, low, medium and high cluster reefs have low
differences between DHW trajectories (@fig-gcm-dhw-trajectories) \[**TI:** **I don't
understand this sentence - what is meant by reefs have low differences?**\]. The highest
peak DHW levels occur under GFDL-CM4 between 2045 and 2050, while greater increases in
overall DHW timeseries occur under ACCESS-CM2.

width="14.82cm"}

Comparing across GCMs, it is common for reefs to switch cluster level, including from low to
high and high to low cluster transitions (@sfig-gcm-bioregion-cluster-assignment). This is
expected as spatial differences in GCM DHW timeseries result in reefs being impacted in
different magnitudes relative to other reefs in their bioregion.

## Bioregion scale clustering

Across many bioregions timeseries clustering identified a ‘low’ cluster containing reefs
that suffer larger declines and generally have lower levels of coral cover than the other
clusters, a ‘medium’ cluster with intermediate levels of coral cover, and a ‘high’ cluster
with greater levels of cover recovery, with persistence to 2050 in some bioregions
(@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-timeseries).

In many bioregions, median reef depth decreases as cluster coral cover decreases, with reefs

# Discussion

Under all GCMs most reefs are projected to suffer substantial declines in coral cover
relative to 2025 levels. NorESM2-MM and ACCESS-ESM1-5 GCMs convey the most coral cover
maintenance into the future. Differences between low, medium and high reef clusters in cover
timeseries are most notable under these two GCMs. Maintainance of coral cover into the
future is not clearly linked to the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity of each GCM used as
ACCESS-ESM1-5 has a higher ECS value than GFDL-CM4, with reefs experiencing large continuous
declines under GFDL-CM4. These large declines are likely due to the high peak thermal stress
levels above 10°C-weeks experienced in the first ten years of the timeseries under GFDL-CM4.

The large differences in cover timeseries seen across the GCMs suggest that it is important
to consider this uncertainty in future conditions when assessing possible biological
responses to change. This is supported by recent literature suggesting an effective approach
to capturing climate change uncertainty is to model responses using a range of GCMs
separately [@shepherd2018]. Despite large differences in coral cover across GCMs, the
patterns identified between low, medium and high clusters of reefs suggest that the
importance of depth refugia is consistent across scenarios.

Reefs in different clusters largely do not differ in mean modelled DHW levels experienced,
and exhibit overall similar DHW timeseries. While these reefs experience similar magnitude
DHWs based on SST, the proportion of the reefs' coral population impacted by heat stress
events depends on reef depth. Our results suggest that within shallow-water reef ecosystems
(non-mesophotic, depth \< 30m), depth contributes greatly to reef resilience and the ability
of the reef to maintain positive carbonate budgets under future conditions. While similar
findings have been demonstrated in the eastern Pacific [@smith2014], depth refugia analyses
have often focussed on the potential of mesophotic reefs (\> 30m deep) as thermal refugia
[@bongaerts2010; @holstein2015; @semmler2017]. In contrast, Venegas et al. [-@venegas2019]
found no association between depth and the alleviation of heat stress across a range of
shallow reefs in the Pacific. Reefs at shallow depths experience no, or few, years with
coral cover exceeding levels likely required to maintain positive carbonate budgets.
Movement of shallow reefs towards negative cabonate budgets in the future may contribute to
phase shifts in reef dominant CaCO~3~ production. Shifting from coral driven to encrusting
algae driven production, or to bioerosion dominated systems with rapid erosion of physical
reef frameworks [@dudgeon2010; @perry2008]. While reefs at increased depths may be able to
maintain coral driven CaCO~3~ production and accumulation into the future for longer.

These findings support the hypothesis that reefs at greater depths will exhibit
characteristics of refugia and more prolonged structural resilience under climate change
compared to shallower reefs. Additionally, Lui, Callaghan and Baldock [-@liu2024] suggest
that rubble instability is inversely correlated with reef depth, possibly limiting the
juvenile recruitment capacity of shallow reefs. A caveat to these depth-resilience findings
is the quality of the bathymetry data used to calculate median reef depth. As detailed
previously, estimates of median reef depth are derived from satellite imagery (at $10m^2$
resolution) which can be subject to high degrees of uncertainty, both in terms of the
estimated depth at for each pixel as well as their alignment to the established GBRMPA reef
outlines.

Current reef restoration and intervention-investigation efforts on the GBR, such as
deployment of coral seeding and fragment devices, target reefs with suitable restoration
sites in the 1-10m depth range [@howlett2021; @randall2021; @whitman2024]. One of the main
constraints on deployment depth is visual identification of target sites from the surface
for deployment and ongoing monitoring, in combination with factors such as deployment method
and tourism return value. Our results suggest that of the reefs analysed within the 1-10m
depth range (1800 reefs), 74% (1328) of reefs fall into the low and medium clusters (across
all GCMs at the GBRMPA management region scale), with many unable to maintain positive
carbonate budgets under future conditions. Reef intervention planning is a complex and
challenging decision making process [@anthony2020], and our results suggest that deployment
site depth is an important factor to consider when assessing the long-term resilience of
deployment sites.

Our findings do not suggest that reefs in ‘high’ cover clusters have greater thermal
tolerance than reefs in lower coral cover clusters. This is in contrast with literature
suggesting corals have the capacity to adapt to increasing climate change pressures
[@humanes2022; @lachs2024], including the investigation by Bairos-Novak et al.
[-@bairos-novak2021] that revealed high heritability of bleaching and survival response
traits, used to inform thermal tolerance trait distributions in this investigation. The lack
of influence of thermal tolerance on reef outcomes is likely due to reefs being impacted by
high levels of thermal stress early in projected conditions and being unable to build
thermal tolerance to DHW levels greater than 9°C-weeks. **\[TI note: This paragraph needs to
be revisited\]**

It is a common conclusion in coral reef ecology that a primary facet of reef resilience is
the degree of larval connectivity between reefs and the supply of recruits that a reef
receives following disturbance [@hock2017; @mumby2008; @torres2024]. In contrast, our
results suggest that there are few differences between resilient and non-resilient reefs in
connectivity metrics such as the ratio of outgoing to incoming larval connectivity and total
connectivity strength. Furthermore, our results suggest no relationship between connectivity
and the ability of reefs to maintain positive carbonate budgets under future conditions.
There has been contrasting evidence [@bode2018; @hock2017] surrounding whether recent
generation connectivity modelling is able to identify reefs that are important for recovery
processes, with findings dependent on the larval connectivity model used. These
investigations were performed using prior generations of larval connectivity models
parameterised for 2008-2013 [@hock2017] and 1996-2002 [@bode2018] time periods. Using
updated 1km resolution larval connectivity across the whole GBR, with a limited temporal
sample of particle flows, our results suggest that larval connectivity alone is not as
important for reef resilience and recovery as environmental refugia such as depth.

Our findings on the importance of connectivity may differ due to the highly uncertain nature
of larval connectivity modelling [@vogt-vincent2023], the way larval flows and juvenile
recruitment are implemented in ADRIA - CoralBlox, and the magnitude of early bleaching
events decreasing the breeding capacity of strongly connected reefs. Analysing daily
connectivity data Vogt-Vincent et al. [-@vogt-vincent2023] suggest that time-mean
connectivity may not be suitable for capturing the seasonal - ecological time scale
connectivity between locations due to high daily variability in connectivity data. This is
supported by the connectivity data used in our investigation, which have large relative
standard deviations for connectivity between reefs over the 24 days used
[@sfig-connectivity-rsd]. Using alternative summarisation methods that capture
ecological-timescale patterns in coral larval dispersal, such as cumulated implicit
connectivity [@vogt-vincent2023], future investigations may find increased importance of
both depth and reef connectivity for resilience, in line with other investigations
[@hock2017; @torres2024]. Further improvements and research in connectivity modelling are
necessary to provide a robust comparison of all factors influencing reef resilience.

There are multiple caveats in how coral ecosystem dynamics are modelled in this
investigation. We model coral colonies as circular diameter values and track these diameters
over timesteps through growth. Due to the availability of quality future projected data we
do not consider the impacts of waves, cyclones, currents and Crown of Thorns Starfish (CoTS)
on coral colony survival and bleaching [@massel1993; @deaker2022]. Uncertainty in
connectivity modelling outputs, satellite-derived bathymetry data and future thermal stress
projections are likely to influence the results obtained in this investigation.
Incorporating further improvements in connectivity modelling and understanding of the
influence of climate change on reef connectivity would improve the comparison of
connectivity as an important factor for reef resilience. The DHW data used in this
investigation have not been bias corrected for the Great Barrier Reef region and are part of
a wider Australian dataset [@dixon2022] developed using statistical downscaling. We
investigate a range of future climate responses, thermal projections and ecological
parameterisations of ADRIA - CoralBlox to account for many possible futures, and our results
suggest the factors that influence reef resilience are consistent across these scenarios.

ADRIA - CoralBlox has not been calibrated or validated at the GBR-wide scale. Accordingly,
the purpose of this investigation is to assess the relative influence of reef
characteristics on future resilience and highlight possible outcomes under uncertain future
scenarios. We do not aim to provide spatially explicit predictions of future resilience.

Further analyses could build on the findings of this study by analysing the impacts of
prioritising reef depth in restoration intervention decision making. The ADRIA platform is
developed as a modelling tool to incorporate multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and
ecosystem scenario modelling into reef restoration decision support. The platform allows for
the investigation of different reef characteristics to be targetted in decision making and
models the evolving outcomes as a result of interventions at various locations. The
capability of ADRIA-CoralBlox could be further expanded by incorporating the impacts of
waves, cyclones, CoTS and currents into future resilience investigations [@lin2023;
@mcclanahan2005; @grimaldi2022; @liu2024]. Additionally, the investigation could be enhanced
by incorporating ocean acidification projections into analyses of coral carbonate budgets.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, our results suggest that when modelled as part of a large and complex
ecosystem, reef depth is a key factor contributing to ongoing reef resilience. We provide
evidence in support of depth as a form of thermal refugia for shallow-water reefs on the
GBR. While protecting ‘key node’ reefs in larval connectivity networks is an important
consideration for reef restoration efforts [@anthony2020; @hock2017], our results suggest
that current connectivity modelling methods are not able to generate connectivity that
contributes to reef resilience under projected conditions. We suggest further analyses that
investigate the benefits of incorporating depth-based resilience into reef decision making,
as well as further research and development in connectivity modelling methods for
whole-ecosystem scales.

## ADRIA - CoralBlox

CoralBlox model incorporates linear extension (growth) and background mortality rates that
are dependent on the size and functional group of a coral colony. Environmental disturbances
and reproduction are not directly considered within CoralBlox. Instead, these factors are
considered by making changes to the distribution of colonies within CoralBlox timesteps
using the ADRIA (Adaptive Dynamic Reef Intervention Algorithms) platform [@iwanaga2023].
Within ADRIA, we incorporate coral life history and environmental events in the following
order: coral colony growth; coral reproduction; larval connectivity and settlement; and
coral bleaching due to heat stress. As ADRIA and CoralBlox are coupled together to represent
the system, we refer to both as ADRIA-CoralBlox.

Coral fecundity rates are dependent on colony size and functional group following the
results of Hall & Hughes [-@hall1996]. Coral fertilization rates are not considered within
this model, however larval survival and viability are incorporated in connectivity modelling
(see Connectivity modelling). Viable larvae settle at a reef location and are incorporated
into the model as the smallest size class but are not directly impacted by modelled
bleaching mortality. There has been contrasting evidence for juvenile corals being immune to
thermal bleaching events [@depczynski2013], we assume the high background mortality of
juveniles includes thermal stress [@álvarez-noriega2018].

### Model parameterisation

CoralBlox uses user-defined size classes that influence size-dependent growth and mortality
rates, through which the coral colonies progress as they grow in diameter. Within ADRIA, we
define the distributions of these parameters, and the size classes based on ecological
monitoring data from the Ecological Intelligence for Reef Restoration Program (EcoRRAP)
([@australianinstituteofmarinescience2025; @ribeirodealmeida2024]).
