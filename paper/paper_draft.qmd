    Coral reefs globally face unprecedented threats from climate change, with the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) experiencing severe declines in coral cover from thermal stress events. Understanding which reefs exhibit resilience to climate impacts is critical for conservation planning and intervention strategies. A scenario-based population modelling approach was adopted with larval connectivity dynamics, thermal adaptation, and environmental factors to assess coral reef resilience across GBR locations under future climate projections. Using five Global Climate Models (GCMs) spanning five Equilibrium Climate Sensitivities, three distinct reef trajectories are identified: resilient reefs maintaining coral cover through 2050, intermediate reefs with moderate declines, and vulnerable reefs experiencing severe degradation. Contrary to expectations, larval connectivity patterns did not substantially differentiate resilient from vulnerable reefs. Instead, reef depth emerged as the primary predictor of resilience, with deeper reefs benefiting from thermal refugia that reduced bleaching impacts. Initial coral cover also influenced trajectories, with reefs having lower initial cover showing greater relative resilience. Our findings suggest that depth provides critical protection against thermal stress, contrasting current restoration practices that primarily target easily accessible shallow sites. These results have important implications for reef management, indicating that depth refugia should be prioritized for further consideration in conservation planning alongside connectivity considerations to maximize coral survival under continuing climate change.

# Introduction

Climate change is impacting species survival, persistence and ecosystem functions globally, including coral. Coral reefs are vulnerable to increasing magnitude and variation in environmental stressors such as ocean temperature, acidification and nutrient loading [@foster2021; @gattuso2014]. Mass bleaching and mortality events linked to climate change can cause reef-building coral population declines, possibly leading to long-term and large-scale coral-macroalgae regime shifts [@arif2022; @wild2011]. Climate impacts on coral reefs are, and will continue to, decrease the ability of coral reefs to provide ecological functions such as benthic habitat and nutrient cycling [@forster2021; @williams2019] as well as ecosystem services such as food, protection, tourism and Indigenous cultural value [@eddy2021; @stoeckl2021]. We aim to assess the impacts of possible climate futures and identify the characteristics of resilient reefs using the latest generation of larval connectivity research with scenario-based population modelling for the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem.

The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the world's largest coral reef ecosystem consisting of thousands of individual reefs. They are interconnected through coral and fish larval dispersal patterns mediated by hydrodynamic, spatial, and ecological processes [@grimaldi2022]. Severe declines in coral cover are projected due to compounding impacts such as ocean warming and acidification, intensification of Tropical Cyclones, and Crown of Thorns Starfish outbreaks [@death2012; @fox-kemper2021; @seneviratne2021; @sweatman2011; @wolff2018]. Ominously, the 2023-24 Summer mass bleaching event ([@cantin2024]) may be signalling a shift towards this reef future, with some level of bleaching recorded on 79% of surveyed reefs.

Environmental abiotic factors influence how reefs will experience climate change pressures, including the spatio-temporal patterns of thermal stress itself, and indirect factors that influence the stress experienced by corals. Environmental factors such as tropical cyclones and wind driven mixing [@lin2023; @mcclanahan2005]; currents [@grimaldi2022] and depth [@álvarez-noriega2018; @baird2018; @smith2014] can decrease the magnitude of thermal stress corals experience. On the other hand, high light intensity and nutrient levels in the benthic zone can increase coral bleaching [@decarlo2020; @higuchi2015]. These environmental factors influence the resilience of reefs to climate change pressures in combination with related biological factors such as larval connectivity and thermal tolerance.

Connectivity in systems such as the GBR is an important contributor to system resilience, as strong connections are required to repopulate locations after disturbance, and drive adaptation to climate pressures [@angeler2023; @elmhirst2009; @hock2017]. When populations that are strong larval suppliers to external reefs are impacted by disturbances, increased adult coral mortality will cause decreased outgoing larvae in the following years. Weaker larval connections then slow the recovery of the externally connected locations [@figueiredo2022; @hock2017; @munday2009]. Populations with greater strength and number of outgoing than incoming larval connections - herein referred to as larval sources - have lower resilience to pressures than populations with greater incoming than outgoing larval flows - referred to as larval sinks - as larval source populations lack external sources of larvae that are important in contributing to reef recovery and recruitment of juveniles after disturbances to existing populations [@ani2024; @hock2017]. Larval source populations are an important component of overall reef resilience as they can contribute larvae to recovering populations at other locations [@hock2017; @thomas2015]. Connectivity will be altered by future climate change impacts such as population fragmentation, increasing larval mortality, and changes to coastal hydrodynamics [@figueiredo2022; @munday2009], and influences the biology of surrounding reef populations.

Many additional biological factors including coral size [@brandt2009], taxa [@álvarez-noriega2018; @mcclanahan2005], and acclimation and inherited thermal tolerance[@humanes2022; @lachs2024], influence the outcome of high coral heat stress. It has been shown that corals have the adaptive capacity to develop thermal tolerance levels capable of delaying the onset of widespread bleaching under low emissions scenarios [@bairos-novak2021; @humanes2022].

Incorporating the latest advancements in whole ecosystem larval connectivity modelling and coral thermal response and adaptation research into coral population modelling allows us to investigate how these abiotic and biotic factors interact and will influence coral climate change resilience into the future. Improvements in coral reef climate response modelling, including sampling from a range of possible climate futures, allow for fine-scale timeseries analyses of uncertain climate change and ecological scenarios [@bode2017; @chollett2022; @donner2018; @klein2024; @uusitalo2015].

It is hypothesised that sink reefs are more likely to be resilient under climate change, compared to source reefs, due to greater influx of coral recruits post disturbance. It is hypothesised that reefs with greater depths are more likely to be resilient under future thermal stress, compared to reefs at shallow depths, as they benefit from thermal refugia. It is hypothesised that reef cover will decline by greater magnitude as the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of each Global Climate Model (GCM) increases.

The spatial extent of GBR coral reefs used in this investigation includes 3806 reef areas. It follows the reef definitions as adopted in ReefMod-GBR [@bozec2022] (@fig-region-map). Annually and spatially averaged Degree Heating Week (DHW) data is used to represent future thermal stress at each reef location. Five Global Climate Models (GCMs) (EC-Earth3-Veg, ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5, NorESM2-MM and GDFL-CM4) from the Sixth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) were selected for this study. Statistically downscaled 1km resolution Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data for the Great Barrier Reef were obtained from the HighResCoralStress database [@dixon2022; @dixon]. Maximum monthly mean DHW levels were calculated from the SST data following NOAA methodology [@liu2017; @skirving2020]. These GCMs were selected from available GCMs downscaled by Dixon et al. [-@dixon] based on evaluation by Grose et al. [-@grose2023], which found high correlation between observed temperature, rainfall, El Niño Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole patterns in the Australian terrestrial region, and the corresponding mechanisms in these GCMs. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is defined, by the IPCC, as the long term warming caused by a doubling of carbon dioxide above its pre-industrial concentration [@forster2021]. The four GCMs span a range of ECS values within the IPCC assessed likely range, and GCM development families, allowing for a range of possible climate futures to be explored, capturing the uncertainty in future responses to CO2 increases (@fig-ecs; [@grose2023; @shepherd2018]). The following analyses are performed using each GCM separately. SSP 2-4.5 is used as a plausible emission pathway under current emission trajectories, with similar atmospheric CO2 levels remaining until 2050 [@hausfather2020; IPCC -@climate2023].

## Coral reef ecosystem model - ADRIA x CoralBlox

CoralBlox is a coral population growth and mortality model that simulates groups of corals growing in diameter and competing for limited space over time [@ribeirodealmeida2024]. This model incorporates linear extension (growth) and background mortality rates that are dependent on the size and functional group of a coral colony. Environmental disturbances and reproduction are not directly considered within CoralBlox. Instead, these factors are considered by making changes to the distribution of colonies within CoralBlox timesteps using the ADRIA (Adaptive Dynamic Reef Intervention Algorithms) platform [@iwanaga2023]. Within ADRIA, we incorporate coral life history and environmental events in the following order: coral colony growth; coral reproduction; larval connectivity and settlement; and coral bleaching due to heat stress. As ADRIA and CoralBlox are coupled together to represent the system, we refer to both as ADRIA-CoralBlox.

Coral fecundity rates are dependent on colony size and functional group following the results of Hall & Hughes [-@hall1996]. Coral fertilization rates are not considered within this model, however larval survival and viability are incorporated in connectivity modelling (see Connectivity modelling). Viable larvae settle at a reef location and are incorporated into the model as the smallest size class but are not directly impacted by modelled bleaching mortality. There has been contrasting evidence for juvenile corals being immune to thermal bleaching events [@depczynski2013], we assume the high background mortality of juveniles includes thermal stress [@álvarez-noriega2018].

### Factors influencing bleaching mortality

We track the thermal tolerance of each functional group and size class as a truncated normal distribution that is updated in each timestep following growth and recruitment. This distribution determines that proportion of the population on a reef that is susceptible to bleaching (i.e. has a thermal threshold below the experienced DHW value). Starting distributions for thermal tolerance levels are informed by Bairos-Novak et al. [-@bairos-novak2021] and unpublished data from Hughes et al. [-@hughes2018].

Tropical cyclones and wave impacts to reefs are not included in this investigation. We scale coral bleaching impacts by a coefficient determined by the median depth of each reef location, following Baird et al. [@baird2018], reducing the proportion of coral colonies on a reef impacted by high heat stress as depth increases. Median depths for each reef location have been extracted from satellite derived bathymetry data for the Great Barrier Reef (GBRMPA [-@gbr10gb2020]) (see discussion for more details). Due to varying degrees of alignment between bathymetry data and the defined outlines for GBR reefs, reefs with less than 5% coverage of valid bathymetry data have been removed from this investigation. Furthermore, reefs that are not allocated to a GBRMPA management area or bioregion have been removed from the investigation, as well as reefs with relative coral cover values greater than five.

## Timeseries analysis

### Reef health metrics

ADRIA-CoralBlox was run for 4096 *sampled* scenarios per GCM. A median absolute coral cover timeseries for each reef was calculated for each GCM. For use in timeseries clustering reef cover timeseries were scaled by the total area of the reef to represent timeseries as a percentage of total reef area (range 0 - 100%). The proportion of each functional group occupying the reef (taxa evenness) was also investigated as a metric for timeseries analysis, but was found to not sufficiently capture the declining condition of reefs suffering from very low absolute coral cover.

### Timeseries clustering

Timeseries analysis is performed by first grouping reefs into three different scales, GBRMPA reefal bioregion, GBRMPA management area and GBR-wide, to investigate the consistency of cluster identification. To identify groups of reefs at each analysis scale that are resilient, intermediate and non-resilient we clustered reef coral cover timeseries into three clusters at each scale. To quantify the behaviour of timeseries and identify timeseries that behave similarly we calculate the complexity-invariant distance (CID) between each timeseries. The complexity-invariant distance refers to the Euclidean distance between two timeseries multiplied (corrected) by the ratio of the complexities of the timeseries [@batista2014]. These values create a distance matrix of n * n dimensions (where n is the number of timeseries in the group) that is clustered using a k-medoids clustering algorithm [@steinmann2020].

## Carbonate budget analysis

To maintain coral cover over time coral reefs require a threshold of coral cover known as a carbonate budget. Estimates of the carbonate budget required to maintain a healthy coral reef range from 10 to 20% of a reef's total area. Using median absolute cover timeseries for each reef we calculated the number of years each reef maintains coral cover above a carbonate budget threshold level. Threshold values from 10 to 20% (inclusive) were used in analyses.

### Further analyses

Reefs in each cluster are compared to identify characteristics that differ between low, medium and high coral cover clusters. These characteristics include reef median depth, mean timeseries DHW, mean timeseries DHW – tolerance level, Pearson’s correlation between total coral cover and inversed DHW timeseries, proportion of coral habitable area occupied by corals in the first timestep, ratio of source-to-sink larval connectivity and total strength of larval connections between reefs. To analyse the DHW - tolerance levels of reefs, heritable DHW – tolerance values were tracked over timeseries in a timestep * taxa * reef * scenario matrix. The mean timeseries was calculated over the first four scenarios for each GCM (four from 4096 scenarios per GCM) due to computational restraints, and then used to calculate an overall mean DHW – tolerance value for each reef under each GCM.

# Results

## Global Climate Model future trajectories

Each GCM shows similar relationships between reefs in clusters of ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ coral cover and contextual analysis factors, thus visual further comparisons of these clusters for each analysis factor are only shown for ACCESS-ESM1-5 GCM (intermediate ECS scenario). Results for the additional GCMs are displayed in the supplementary material. However, there are substantial differences in the longevity of reef resilience and maintenance of coral cover post 2030 between the GCMs, thus relative coral cover timeseries are displayed for each GCM (displayed at management-area scale to preserve coarse spatial differences in coral trajectories) (@fig-gcm-trajectories).

NorESM2-MM has the lowest Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (2.5°C) and reefs exhibit continuing recovery and decline dynamics up to 2074 under this possible climate future. While recovery phases are predominantly seen in the ‘high’ cover cluster, the ‘medium’ cluster, and to a lesser degree the ‘low’ cluster, also exhibit periods of increasing relative coral cover up to 2045. Under NorESM2-MM GCM the Far Northern management area does not see relative coral cover maintenance as high as the three remaining management regions. Under the second lowest ECS projection (GFDL-CM4, 2.9°C) all clusters in each management area exhibit largely declining future trajectories with periods of recovery from 2030 to 2040. ACCESS-ESM1-5 has an intermediate ECS value of 3.87°C which results in intermediate levels of coral cover maintenance (between those of lower and higher ECS GCMs). In all management areas reefs in the high cluster are able to maintain relative coral cover levels to 2050 under ACCESS-ESM1-5. Under ACCESS-CM2 (4.72°C) and EC-Earth3-Veg (4.31°C) GCMs relative cover trajectories are largely declining, with the exception of ‘high/medium’ clusters in the Cairns-Cooktown management area under EC-Earth3-Veg that display prolonged relative cover maintenance.

![Reef relative coral cover timeseries clustered within each management area, for each GCM analysed. ‘Low’ clusters (green) are clusters with the lowest median relative cover between 2030 and 2040 within each bioregion. ‘Medium’ clusters (orange) are clusters with intermediate median relative cover between 2030 and 2040 within each bioregion. ‘High’ clusters (blue) are clusters with the highest median relative cover between 2030 and 2040 within each bioregion. Solid lines represent the cluster median timeseries and bands represent the 2.5 to 97.5 percentile confidence intervals. Each management area is represented five times (for each GCM), with each GCM displayed horizontally.](/../outputs/ADRIA_results/HighResCoralStress/figs/GCM_timeseries_plot.png){#fig-gcm-trajectories width=`{julia} timeseries_width`}

Across the five GCMs, 50% (1812) of reefs, at management region scale, remain in the same ‘low, medium, high’ cluster assignment. 1757 Reefs (49%) that changed clusters by one level across the GCMs (e.g. a reef is assigned ‘low’ and ‘medium’ in different GCMs), while 46 (1%) reefs changed clusters by two levels across the GCMs (e.g. a reef is assigned ‘low’ and ‘high’ in different GCMs).

## Reef carbonate budget
The number of years reefs maintain coral cover above a required carbonate budget level substantially decreases as the required carbonate budget threshold (as a percentage of reef area) increases. Reefs with greater median depth levels maintain coral cover above required carbonate budget levels for longer than reefs at shallow depths [@fig-access-esm1-5-depth-carbonate]. There are no clear relationships between reef total connectivity levels and the number of years reefs maintain coral cover above carbonate budget threshold levels [@sfig-access-esm1-5-conn-carbonate].

## Bioregion scale clustering

Within bioregions timeseries clustering analysis was able to identify three clusters of relative cover timeseries. Across many bioregions timeseries clustering identified a ‘low’ cluster containing reefs that suffer larger declines and generally have lower levels of relative coral cover than the other clusters, a ‘medium’ cluster with intermediate levels of relative coral cover, and a ‘high’ cluster with cover recovery that persists to 2050 in many bioregions (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-timeseries; @sfig-access-cm2-bioregion-timeseries; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-bioregion-timeseries; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-bioregion-timeseries; @sfig-noresm2-mm-bioregion-timeseries).

In many bioregions, median reef depth decreases as cluster relative coral cover decreases, with reefs within the ‘high’ cluster commonly having the greatest median reef depths within the bioregion (@fig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-depth; @sfig-access-cm2-bioregion-depth; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-bioregion-depth; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-bioregion-depth; @sfig-noresm2-mm-bioregion-depth).

Correlation between reef total coral cover and reef DHW timeseries decreases as cluster relative coral cover decreases, with reefs in the ‘high’ cluster commonly having the greatest total cover – DHW timeseries correlation levels (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-dhwcor; @sfig-access-cm2-bioregion-dhwcor; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-bioregion-dhwcor; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-bioregion-dhwcor; @sfig-noresm2-mm-bioregion-dhwcor).

Conversely, there are no consistent patterns across bioregions in reef relative cover and mean timeseries DHW levels, with clusters having similar mean DHW levels in many bioregions (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-dhwmean; @sfig-access-cm2-bioregion-dhwmean; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-bioregion-dhwmean; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-bioregion-dhwmean; @sfig-noresm2-mm-bioregion-dhwmean).

In some bioregions (4 for ACCESS-ESM1-5) reefs in the ‘low’ cluster have substantially lower mean thermal tolerance levels compared to reefs in other clusters. However, many bioregions do not show strong differences in thermal tolerance levels (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-dhwtol; @sfig-access-cm2-bioregion-dhwtol; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-bioregion-dhwtol; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-bioregion-dhwtol; @sfig-noresm2-mm-bioregion-dhwtol).

In many bioregions reefs with high relative coral cover levels (‘high’ cluster) have the lowest initial proportions of habitable area occupied by corals, while reefs in the ‘low’ cluster often have the highest initial proportions of coral habitable area occupied by corals (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-initialproportion; @sfig-access-cm2-bioregion-initialproportion; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-bioregion-initialproportion; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-bioregion-initialproportion; @sfig-noresm2-mm-bioregion-initialproportion).

Across most bioregions there are not consistent differences between clusters in connectivity metrics such as source-to-sink connectivity ratio (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-logsosi; @sfig-access-cm2-bioregion-logsosi; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-bioregion-logsosi; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-bioregion-logsosi; @sfig-noresm2-mm-bioregion-logsosi) and total connectivity strength (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-totalconnectivity; @sfig-access-cm2-bioregion-totalconnectivity; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-bioregion-totalconnectivity; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-bioregion-totalconnectivity; @sfig-noresm2-mm-bioregion-totalconnectivity).

## Management area scale clustering

Within the four management areas, timeseries clustering analysis identified three clusters of reefs using relative coral cover timeseries. These clusters form groups of reefs with ‘low, medium and high’ relative coral cover, categorised by their median coral cover between 2030 and 2040. The ‘high’ cover cluster of reefs contains reefs that have continuing recovery of corals throughout the future climate scenario. The medium and low clusters contain many reefs that decrease to half their initial coral cover levels and largely do not display the levels of recurring recovery that reefs in high clusters experience (@sfig-access-esm1-5-manarea-timeseries; @sfig-access-cm2-manarea-timeseries; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-manarea-timeseries; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-manarea-timeseries; @sfig-noresm2-mm-manarea-timeseries).

Within each bioregion reef median depth level increases with increasing reef relative coral cover. Reefs in the low cluster have the lowest median depth levels, while reefs in the high cluster have the highest median depth levels within each management area (@sfig-access-esm1-5-manarea-depth; @sfig-access-cm2-manarea-depth; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-manarea-depth; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-manarea-depth; @sfig-noresm2-mm-manarea-depth).

Correlation between reef total coral cover and the DHW levels they experience throughout the time period increases as coral relative cover increases, with reefs in the high cluster having the highest median total cover – DHW correlation (@sfig-access-esm1-5-manarea-dhwcor; @sfig-access-cm2-manarea-dhwcor; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-manarea-dhwcor; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-manarea-dhwcor; @sfig-noresm2-mm-manarea-dhwcor).

However, reefs with higher relative coral cover levels do not experience lower mean DHW levels throughout their timeseries. There are no consistent substantial differences in mean DHW levels across the identified timeseries clusters (@sfig-access-esm1-5-manarea-dhwmean; @sfig-access-cm2-manarea-dhwmean; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-manarea-dhwmean; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-manarea-dhwmean; @sfig-noresm2-mm-manarea-dhwmean).

Within the Far Northern management area ‘low’ cluster reefs have substantially lower median DHW – tolerance levels than ‘medium’ and ‘high’ clusters, while there are no substantial differences in DHW – tolerance between clusters in other management areas (@sfig-access-esm1-5-manarea-dhwtol; @sfig-access-cm2-manarea-dhwtol; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-manarea-dhwtol; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-manarea-dhwtol; @sfig-noresm2-mm-manarea-dhwtol).

Like clusters identified within bioregions, within the Mackay-Capricorn, Far Northern and Cairns-Cooktown management areas the initial proportion of coral-habitable area initially occupied by corals decreases in clusters with higher relative coral cover (@sfig-access-esm1-5-manarea-initialproportion; @sfig-access-cm2-manarea-initialproportion; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-manarea-initialproportion; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-manarea-initialproportion; @sfig-noresm2-mm-manarea-initialproportion).

At management area analysis scales, there are not consistent substantial differences in source – to – sink ratios (@sfig-access-esm1-5-manarea-logsosi; @sfig-access-cm2-manarea-logsosi; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-manarea-logsosi; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-manarea-logsosi; @sfig-noresm2-mm-manarea-logsosi) and total connectivity strength (@sfig-access-esm1-5-manarea-totalconnectivity; @sfig-access-cm2-manarea-totalconnectivity; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-manarea-totalconnectivity; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-manarea-totalconnectivity; @sfig-noresm2-mm-manarea-totalconnectivity).

## Great Barrier Reef scale clustering

Timeseries clustering identified three clusters in reef relative cover timeseries for the whole GBR scale. A ‘low’ cluster of reefs with little recovery following initial declines, a medium cluster of reefs with median relative cover below 0.5 post 2028, and a high cluster of reefs with median relative cover above 0.5 until 2050 (@sfig-access-esm1-5-gbr-timeseries; @sfig-access-cm2-gbr-timeseries; @sfig-ec-earth3-veg-gbr-timeseries; @sfig-gfdl-cm4-gbr-timeseries; @sfig-noresm2-mm-gbr-timeseries).


The clusters identified with timeseries clustering at the GBR scale show similar patterns to clusters identified at bioregion and management area scales.

# Discussion

Timeseries analysis has been used to identify three groups of reefs with similar declining (low), recovering (high), and intermediate (medium) coral cover trajectories throughout future scenarios. Under all GCMs most reefs suffer substantial declines in coral cover from 2025 levels. NorESM2-MM and ACCESS-ESM1-5 GCMs convey the most coral cover maintanance into the future. The differences between low, medium and high reef clusters in their timeseries are most notable under these two GCMs. At all analysis scales reef clusters show similar patterns in their reef characteristics such as depth and proportion of habitable area initially occupied.

Reefs in different clusters largely do not differ in mean modelled DHW levels experienced, and exhibit overall similar DHW timeseries. While these reefs experience similar magnitude DHWs based on SST, the proportion of the reef’s coral population impacted by heat stress events depends on the depth of the reef. Analysis from Baird et al. [-@baird2018] is used to calculate the degree of protection provided to a reef based on the median depth. Our results suggest that within shallow reef ecosystems (depth < 30m), depth contributes greatly to reef resilience and the ability of the reef to maintain cover under heat stress. While similar findings have been demonstrated in the eastern Pacific [@smith2014], depth refugia analyses have often focussed on the potential of mesophotic reefs (> 30m deep) as thermal refugia [@bongaerts2010; @holstein2015; @semmler2017]. In contrast, Venegas et al. [-@venegas2019] found no association between depth and the alleviation of heat stress across a range of shallow reefs in the Pacific. 
<!-- The depth refugia found on a reef in turn influences the degree of correlation between coral cover timeseries and DHW levels. Reefs in low and medium clusters have lower levels of cover – DHW correlation than those in high clusters, due to their initial sharp declines in coral cover combined with low depth – refugia in the face of persistently high thermal stress these reefs do not recover post 2030, leaving little ability to decline further in periods of high thermal stress and recover in periods of low thermal stress. -->

Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that reefs at greater depths will experience refugia benefits and more prolonged resilience under climate change compared to shallower reefs. Additionally, [-@liu2024] suggest that rubble instability is inversely correlated with reef depth, possibly limiting the larval recruitment capacity of shallow reefs. A caveat to these findings is the quality of the bathymetry data used to calculate depth refugia benefits in ADRIA. This data (GBRMPA [-@gbr10gb2020]) is derived from satellite imagery and is limited in its alignment with the established GBRMPA reef outlines used in the investigation to characterise reef locations. As a result, 842 reefs (22% of the 3806) were removed from the analyses before depth comparisons due to having less than 5% coverage of depth data. Additionally, deriving estimates of depth from satellite imagery is prone to high degrees of uncertainty. Data adopted for the given assessment are said to be accurate up to 15m from Mean Sea Level [@gbr10gb2020]. Furthermore, an estimated median depth is determined for each reef, using the established GBRMPA reef outlines to provide an indication of “true” reef extent. Therefore, the estimates of reef depths are taken as a useful indication rather than an accurate and precise report of reef depths across the GBR.

Current reef restoration and intervention-investigation efforts on the Great Barrier Reef, such as deployment of coral seeding and fragment devices target reefs with suitable restoration sites in the 1-10m depth range [@howlett2021; @randall2021; @whitman2024]. One of the main depth constraints is being able to visually identify the target site from the surface for deployment and ongoing monitoring, in combination with factors such as deployment method and tourism return value. Our results suggest that of the reefs analysed within the 1-10m depth range (1800 reefs) 74% (1328) of reefs fall into the low and medium clusters (across all GCMs at the GBRMPA management region scale), with many suffering large future declines in reef health under climate change and possibly limiting the potential of interventions to deliver recovery in these locations. Reef intervention planning is a complex and challenging decision making process [@anthony2020], and our results suggest that deployment site depth is an important factor to consider when assessing the long-term resilience of reef sites.

Overall, our findings do not suggest that resilient reefs in ‘high’ cover clusters have greater thermal tolerance than reefs in lower coral cover clusters. This is in contrast with literature suggesting corals have the capacity to adapt to increasing climate change pressures [@humanes2022; @lachs2024], including the investigation by Bairos-Novak et al. [-@bairos-novak2021] that revealed high heritability of bleaching and survival response traits used to inform the distributions of thermal tolerance traits used in this investigation. The lack of influence of thermal tolerance on reef outcomes is likely due to reef being impacted by overall similar levels of thermal stress, combined with the greater importance of factors such as reef depth and initial coral cover.

It has been suggested that a primary facet of reef resilience is the degree of larval connectivity between reefs and the supply of recruits that a reef receives following disturbance [@hock2017]. It was expected that resilient reefs would have greater incoming than outgoing larval connectivity to promote recovery in years following thermal stress, while non-resilient reefs would have greater outgoing than incoming connectivity inhibiting recruitment of corals ability post thermal stress. In contrast, our results suggest that there are few differences between resilient and non-resilient reefs in connectivity metrics such as the ratio of outgoing to incoming larval connectivity and total connectivity strength. Hock et al. [-@hock2017] used larval connectivity modelling to identify resilient reefs that may supply up to 47% of the wider Great Barrier Reef ecosystem with larvae following disturbance. A critique of this approach [@bode2018] is that results obtained are highly sensitive to the biophysical dispersal model used, limiting the application of specific identified reefs. Reef depth was not considered in these investigations of reef network resilience. These investigations were performed using prior generations of larval connectivity models parameterised for 2008-2013 [@hock2017] and 1996-2002 [@bode2018] time periods respectively. Using updated 1km resolution larval connectivity across the whole GBR, our results suggest that larval connectivity alone is not as important for reef resilience and recovery as environmental refugia from thermal stress such as depth.

Furthermore, our results suggest that the capacity of reefs to maintain healthy coral habitat by being above positive net carbonate budget levels is greater for reefs at deeper depths than shallow depths. While the maintanence of positive carbonate budget levels does not appear to be influenced by reef connectivity metrics. The maintanence of positive carbonate budgets is important for reef resilience under climate change.

Five different GCMs were included in analyses to capture uncertainty in climate system responses to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. The large differences in relative cover timeseries seen across the GCMs suggest that it is important to consider this uncertainty in analyses of biological climate change responses. This is supported by recent literature suggesting an effective approach to capturing climate change uncertainty is to model climate change responses using a range of climate models separately [@shepherd2018]. However, the patterns identified between low, medium and high clusters of reefs suggest that the importance of depth refugia is consistent across scenarios. Similarly, at the management area scale, only 1% of reefs were assigned a ‘low’ and ‘high’ cluster in different GCMs, suggesting that intrinsic reef properties can prevent high cover resilient reefs from crashing under a different future climate scenario.

There are multiple caveats in how coral ecosystem dynamics are modelled in this investigation. We model coral colonies as objects with circular diameter values and track these diameters over timesteps through growth. Due to the availability of quality future projected data we do not consider the impacts of waves, cyclones and currents on coral colony survival and bleaching (insert citations for waves affecting survival and bleaching). We do not consider the impacts of Crown of Thorns Starfish (CoTS) on coral survival and reef resilience (insert citation for cots affecting corals). Furthermore, there are multiple caveats to acknowledge in the data sources used in this investigation. Uncertainty in connectivity modelling outputs, satellite-derived bathymetry data and future thermal stress projections are likely to influence the results obtained in this investigation. To limit the influence of bathymetry data on results, reefs with less than 5% data coverage are removed from analyses. We investigate a range of future climate responses and thermal projections to account for a range of possible futures, and our results suggest the factors that influence reef resilience are consistent across these scenarios.

Further analyses could build on the findings of this study by analysing the impacts of prioritising reef depth in reef restoration intervention decision making. The ADRIA platform is developed as a modelling tool to incorporate multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and ecosystem scenario modelling into reef restoration decision analysis. The platform allows for the investigation of different reef characteristics to be targetted in decision making and models the evolving outcomes as a result of reef interventions at various locations. The capability of ADRIA-CoralBlox could be further expanded by incorporating the impacts of waves, cyclones, CoTS and currents into reef resilience investigations [@lin2023; @mcclanahan2005; @grimaldi2022; @liu2024]. Additionally, the investigation could be enhanced by incorporating future ocean acidification into considerations of coral carbonate budgets required for healthy habitat production.

# Conclusions

Overall, our results suggest that when modelled as part of a large and complex ecosystem, reef depth is a key factor contributing to ongoing reef resilience. We provide evidence in support of depth as a form of refugia for shallow reefs. While protecting ‘key node’ reefs in larval connectivity networks is an important consideration for reef restoration efforts [@anthony2020; @hock2017], our results suggest that resilient reefs do not have greater incoming or total connectivity to contribute to their resilience. Instead, we suggest that depth, and likely other environmental thermal refugia mechanisms contribute greater to overall reef resilience and recovery. We suggest further analyses that investigate the benefits of incorporating depth-based resilience into reef decision making.

## Model parameterisation

CoralBlox uses user-defined size classes that influence size-dependent growth and mortality rates, through which the coral colonies progress as they grow in diameter. Within ADRIA, we define the distributions of these parameters, and the size classes based on ecological monitoring data from the Ecological Intelligence for Reef Restoration Program (EcoRRAP) ([@australianinstituteofmarinescience2025; @ribeirodealmeida2024]).
