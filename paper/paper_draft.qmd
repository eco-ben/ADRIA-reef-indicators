    Coral reefs globally face unprecedented threats from climate change, with the Great Barrier
    Reef (GBR) experiencing severe declines in coral cover from thermal stress events.
    Understanding which reefs exhibit resilience to climate impacts is critical for conservation
    planning and intervention strategies. A scenario-based population modelling approach was
    adopted with larval connectivity dynamics, thermal adaptation, and environmental factors
    to assess coral reef resilience across GBR locations under future climate projections.
    Using five Global Climate Models (GCMs) spanning five Equilibrium Climate Sensitivities,
    we analysed reef cover timeseries and the ability of reefs to maintain positive carbonate
    production budgets under future conditions. Contrary to expectations, larval connectivity
    patterns did not correlate with increases in maintainence of positive carbonate budgets.
    Instead, reef depth emerged as the primary predictor of cover-timeseries resilience and
    maintainence of positive carbonate budgets, with deeper reefs benefiting from thermal
    refugia that reduce bleaching impacts. Our findings suggest that depth provides critical
    protection against thermal stress, contrasting current restoration practices that primarily
    target easily accessible shallow sites. These results have important implications for
    reef management, indicating that depth refugia should be prioritized for further
    consideration in conservation planning alongside connectivity considerations to maximize
    coral survival under continuing climate change.

# Introduction

Climate change is impacting species survival, persistence and ecosystem functions globally,
including coral reefs. Coral reefs are vulnerable to increasing magnitude and variation in
environmental stressors such as ocean temperature, acidification and nutrient loading
[@foster2021; @gattuso2014]. Mass bleaching and mortality events linked to climate change
can cause reef-building coral population declines, possibly leading to long-term and
large-scale coral-macroalgae regime shifts [@arif2022; @wild2011]. Climate impacts on coral
reefs are, and will continue to, decrease the ability of coral reefs to provide ecological
functions such as benthic habitat and nutrient cycling [@forster2021; @williams2019] as well
as ecosystem services such as food, protection, tourism and Indigenous cultural value
[@eddy2021; @stoeckl2021].

Understanding the characteristics of reefs that will persist under projected climate
conditions requires examining reef resilience across multiple scales and processes.
Structural resilience - the capacity to maintain coral populations and avoid ecosystem
regime shifts - depends on three interconnected mechanisms. First, the ability of individual
corals to survive thermal stress. Second, the connectivity networks that enable
recolonisation after disturbances. Third, the maintenance of the carbonate framework that
provides reef structure. We aim to assess how these mechanisms interact under projected
climate conditions to identify the characteristics of structurally resilient reefs through
scenario-based coral population modelling for the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem.

The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the world's largest coral reef ecosystem consisting of
thousands of individual reefs. They are interconnected through coral and fish larval
dispersal patterns mediated by hydrodynamic, spatial, and ecological processes
[@grimaldi2022]. The GBR faces severe projected coral cover declines under climate change
[@bozec2025; @bozec2022]. These coral cover declines will be compounded by ocean
acidification, intensifying tropical cyclones, and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks
[@death2012; @fox-kemper2021; @seneviratne2021; @sweatman2011; @wolff2018]. The 2023-24
Summer mass bleaching event may be signalling a shift towards this reef future, with some
level of bleaching recorded on 79% of surveyed reefs (total 1001 surveyed reefs)
[@cantin2024].

At the individual coral scale, survival during thermal stress events depends on both
environmental and biological factors. Environmental factors can either amplify or reduce
thermal stress exposure. Depth has been suggested as one crucial factor that can provide a
refuge from thermal stress [@álvarez-noriega2018; @baird2018; @smith2014]. Biological
factors including coral size [@brandt2009], taxa [@álvarez-noriega2018; @mcclanahan2005],
and thermal tolerance through acclimation and inheritance [@humanes2022; @lachs2024] all
influence survival outcomes. Importantly, corals demonstrate adaptive capacity to develop
thermal tolerance that could delay widespread bleaching under moderate emission scenarios
[@bairos-novak2021; @humanes2022], representing a crucial mechanism for reef persistence.

Beyond individual survival, reef-scale resilience depends on connectivity networks that
enable recolonization after disturbances [@angeler2023; @elmhirst2009; @hock2017]. However,
connectivity creates both strengths and vulnerabilities. Larval source populations that
export more larvae than they import are essential for system-wide recovery, providing larvae
that enable recolonization at distant locations [@hock2017; @thomas2015]. Yet these source
reefs are paradoxically more vulnerable individually, relying heavily on local recruitment
for their own recovery. When disturbances impact major source populations, cascading effects
reduce larval export and slow recovery throughout the connected network [@figueiredo2022;
@hock2017; @munday2009].

Long-term reef viability requires not only coral survival and recolonization, but also
maintenance of the physical reef structure through positive carbonate budgets. Scleractinian
corals build the primary habitat framework, but reef persistence depends on the balance
between carbonate accumulation [@perry2015] and loss through bioerosion, physical damage
[@kenyon2023], and dissolution [@eyre2014; @eyre2018]. This balance is influenced by coral
cover and community complexity [@perry2012; @desbiens2021], environmental processes, and
ocean chemistry [@perry2015; @eyre2018]. For Great Barrier Reef mid and outer shelf reefs,
maintaining positive carbonate budgets requires approximately 17% live coral cover
[@desbiens2021].

Recent advances in whole-ecosystem larval connectivity modelling and coral thermal response
research enable integrated investigation of how these multiple factors interact to determine
climate resilience. By incorporating the latest coral population models
[@ribeirodealmeida2024], ecosystem-wide connectivity data, and updated climate projections
[@dixon2022], we can examine which factors most strongly influence reef persistence under
different scenarios. While connectivity has been emphasized as critical for GBR resilience
[@hock2017], and remains an important consideration, our integrated modelling reveals depth
may play a fundamental role in determining maintenance of reef coral populations and
positive carbonate budgets under current projections of climate change.

# Methods

## Reef definitions

The spatial extent of the GBR reefs represented in this investigation follows the reef
definitions available via the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA)
[@GBRMPA2022]. The reef definitions define 3806 reefs across the GBR. An indicative map of
the GBR marine park including the Marine Park management areas [@GBRMPA2007] and the
corresponding bioregion for each reef is shown in (@fig-region-map; [@GBRMPA2024]).

Depth characteristics for each reef were extracted using 10m resolution bathymetry data made
available in GBRMPA [-@GBRMPA2020]. For each reef, bathymetry data were spatially matched
with the 3806 reef outlines through geometric intersection analysis. Depth values within
each reef polygon were summarized using zonal statistics. All depth values were converted to
positive values (depths below sea level). The median depth was used to provide an indicative
depth value for each reef. Code, and the resulting depth estimates, are available at
**\[cite Canonical Reefs repo\]**.

While the bathymetry data adopted for the given assessment are said to be accurate up to 15m
from Mean Sea Level [@GBRMPA2020], there are many sources of uncertainty in the depth
estimates used for this study. These are outlined further in the Discussion. Notably, the
adopted depth estimates were derived from bathymetries based on satellite imagery. The
bathymetry data can be limited in their alignment with the established GBRMPA reef outlines
used to characterise reef locations and their areal extent. A Quality Assessment and Control
process identified reefs with potential data limitations: reefs with no overlapping
bathymetry data, reefs with minimum depth values above sea level (indicating potential data
artifacts), and reefs where bathymetry pixels covered less than 5% of the reef polygon area.
This process removed 842 reefs, or 22%, from the initial set of 3806 reefs. Furthermore,
reefs that are not associated with GBRMPA management areas [@GBRMPA2007] or reefal
bioregions [@GBRMPA2024] were also removed from the investigation. Bioregions which
contained fewer than three reefs were also excluded. As a result, 1377 reefs were excluded
(36%), leaving a total of 2429 remaining for the purpose of this investigation.

## Degree Heating Week trajectories

Future projections of maximum yearly Degree Heating Weeks (DHWs) for each reef were
estimated from Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data for the GBR. Statistically downscaled
1km^2^ resolution SST data for five Global Climate Models (GCMs) were obtained from the
HighResCoralStress database [@dixon2022; @dixon2023]. These five GCMs were EC-Earth3-Veg,
ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5, NorESM2-MM and GFDL-CM4. The selected GCMs are a part of the
Sixth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), spanning four 'model
development families' as defined by Brunner et al., [-@brunner2020].

These GCMs were selected based on based on evaluation conducted by Grose et al.,
[-@grose2023], indicating their ability to recreate historical atmospheric temperature and
precipitation conditions in the Australasian region. They span a range of Equilibrium
Climate Sensitivity (ECS) values within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
assessed likely range. The IPCC defines ECS as the long term warming caused by a doubling of
carbon dioxide above its pre-industrial concentration [@forster2021]. While this assessment
does not consider oceanic data, Grose et al. [-@grose2023] provide a region-specific
selection mechanism which we use as an indicator of general performance of GCMs for the
region. An overview of the selected GCMs are provided in @tbl-gcms. Note here that Grose et
al., [-@grose2023] assessed GFDL-ESM4, whereas Dixon et al., [-@dixon2022; -@dixon2023]
provides data based on GFDL-CM4. Similarly, data for ACCESS-CM2 was used as a stand-in for
ACCESS-ESM1-5. These substitutions are assumed appropriate given they share the same
fundamental representation of the physical climate system.

Projections using Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5 was used to represent the
plausible emission pathway. It represents a moderate emissions scenario with continued CO2
emissions comparable to present day until 2050, after which emissions gradually decline
[@hausfather2020; IPCC -@climate2023]. The selected GCMs represent 2.5°C to 4.31°C **\[TI:
Use K or Celcius?\]** of global atmospheric warming in the 2081-2100 period relative to
1850-1900. The use of this range of GCMs therefore allow for a range of possible climate
futures to be explored, capturing the uncertainty in future responses to CO2 increases
(@sfig-ecs; @fig-methods-dhws; [@grose2023; @shepherd2018]) and enables the assessment of
model projected coral reef behaviour over a broad range of independently derived climate
futures [@abramowitz2019].

Monthly mean SST climatological baselines, for each 1km^2^ pixel, were calculated from the
daily SST data following NOAA methodology [@liu2017; @skirving2020]. For each pixel of SST
data, the Monthly Mean SST climatology was calculated by computing the mean SST value for
each calendar month (January through December) across the 28-year baseline period from 1985
to 2012. For each month separately, this climatological baseline was then adjusted to center
at year 1988.2857, which attempts to account for any long-term trends within the baseline
years themselves (see Skirving et al. [@skirving2020]). The adjustment ensures that the
climatology represents conditions at a specific temporal reference point rather than being
influenced by gradual warming or cooling trends that may have occurred during the 1985-2012
period. The resulting monthly climatologies serve as a standardized reference against which
current SST conditions can be compared to identify thermal anomalies and assess coral
bleaching risk, following the methodology established by Skirving et al. [-@skirving2020].

Degree Heating Weeks (DHWs) were then derived using the "HotSpot SST Anomaly" approach
[@skirving2020]. The "HotSpot SST Anomaly" represents the thermal stress experienced by
coral reefs and is calculated as the difference between daily SST values and the maximum of
a pixel's monthly mean climatology across all twelve months (i.e., the maximum monthly mean
SST). This approach uses the annual maximum temperature as the baseline because corals are
adapted to withstand their local warmest conditions under normal seasonal cycles. When
temperatures exceed this seasonal maximum, corals experience thermal stress that can lead to
bleaching. Only positive anomalies are considered relevant for coral stress, as temperatures
below the seasonal maximum do not contribute to bleaching risk.

DHW values on a per-pixel basis at 1km^2^ resolution were then calculated as the 12-week
rolling sum of positive HotSpot SST Anomaly values, expressed in units of °C-weeks. The
12-week accumulation period reflects the cumulative nature of coral thermal stress. Brief
temperature spikes may be tolerable, but sustained or repeated exposure to elevated
temperatures causes progressively greater physiological stress and bleaching severity. DHW
values integrate both the magnitude and duration of thermal stress: a moderate anomaly
(e.g., 1°C) sustained for 12 weeks produces the same DHW value as a severe anomaly (e.g.,
3°C) lasting 4 weeks, though the biological impacts may differ. DHW estimates for each
indicative reef (see @GBRMPA2022) were then determined by taking the mean DHW value for all
pixels touching each reef outline. The process described here was conducted for all 2429
reefs to create DHW projections spanning from 2025 to 2075. Code used to calculate DHW data
and perform analyses involved in this investigation can be found at **\[insert repo

## Assessment framework

An exploratory scenario modelling approach is adopted for this investigation. The method
involves exploring a wide range of plausible futures under different assumptions of
environmental (climatic) conditions and ecological factors. Exploratory scenario modelling
embraces uncertainty as an inherent characteristic of complex environmental systems
[@lempert2010] and is a core methodology underpinning the development of robust and adaptive
management strategies [@haasnoot2013].

Exploratory modelling approaches have gained favour in recent years as precise long-term
predictions of future conditions are often impossible in complex systems like coral reefs.
Multiple interacting and compounding sources of uncertainty, and a lack of broad agreement
as to their likelihood, create inherently uncertain outcomes. Rather than attempting to
forecast specific outcomes, exploratory modelling aims to systematically explore many
possible futures to identify patterns and, in management contexts, robust strategies that
perform well across those diverse conditions, as well as conditions in which such strategies
may fail. Such an exploratory approach lends itself well to the purpose of the
investigation. Specifically, to assess the role of DHW, connectivity, and depth to identify
the environmental and reef characteristics that support structural resilience.

### Scenario modelling

To apply exploratory scenario modelling, the approach employed a modelling framework
involving two separate systems: ADRIA (the Adaptive Dynamic Reef Interventin Algorithms
platform) and CoralBlox. ADRIA is a multi-criteria decision support platform designed to
help reef managers address climate change challenges in coral reef systems [@iwanaga2023].
The ADRIA platform provides functionality for scenario generation and analysis as well as
providing the technical infrastructure to couple environmental and ecosystem
representations. CoralBlox is a computationally efficient coral population model. It
simulates functional/morphological groups of corals over its life cycle, competing for
available space over time [@ribeirodealmeida2024]. The coupled framework is referred to as
ADRIA-CoralBlox.

The coral demographic representation and associated model implementation are further
detailed in the supplementary material. Of important note, however, is that the
representation of bleaching mortalities follow Bozec et al., [-@bozec2022] albeit with a
scaling coefficient to incorporate the amelioration effect that depth may have, following
Baird et al., [@baird2018]. The scaling reduces the proportion of coral colonies impacted by
high heat stress as depth increases. Tropical cyclones and impact of wave activity on reefs
were not included in this investigation.

ADRIA-CoralBlox was run for 4096 scenarios for each of the five GCMs (20,480 total model
runs). Here, a scenario represents a unique combination of assumed environmental (namely one
of the five DHW trajectories) and ecological factors including coral growth and mortality
rates, coral thermal tolerances. Scenarios were generated using the low-discrepancy Sobol'
sampling method [@sobol1967; @sobol1993] with Owen Scrambling [@owen1995], a random-Quasi
Monte Carlo approach which balances scenario exploration with improved convergence
properties (compared to pseudo-random sampling). A detailed comparative analysis of the
sampling methods can be found in [@kucherenko2015].

For the purpose of scenario assessment, the resulting timeseries for each model run were
scaled by the total area of the reef to represent cover as a percentage of the total
estimated reef area. These timeseries of coral cover were then clustered based on their
temporal behaviour.

### Timeseries clustering

To identify groups of reefs that are resilient, intermediate, and non-resilient, we
clustered reefs into three clusters based on their temporal behaviour as indicated by coral
cover over time. The Complexity-Invariant Distance (CID) between each timeseries was
calculated to identify timeseries that behave similarly [@batista2014]. The CID corrects the
Euclidean distance between pairs of timeseries (which accounts for magnitude differences)
with the complexity of each timeseries (obtained through a measure of their variability) to
ensure reefs are clustered based on their underlying temporal dynamics rather than simply
their average coral cover. The process creates a distance matrix of n \* n dimensions (where
n is the number of timeseries in the group) that is clustered using a k-medoids clustering
algorithm [cf. @steinmann2020].

Timeseries clustering analyses were performed at the management area and reefal bioregion
scale (defined in GBRMPA [-@GBRMPA2024]). Additional analyses were also performed at the
whole-of-GBR scale. These were found to lead to identical conclusions and so are not shown
here. To compare timeseries clustering results across GCMs, management area scale clustering
results are used to preserve coarse scale latitudinal differences between regions, while
maintaining ease of comparison and visualisation. These comparisons include quantification
of differences between low and high cover clusters across management regions under each GCM
using the Complexity-Invariant Distance between cluster median timeseries. To assess how
different reef characteristics influence timeseries clustering at a finer scale, bioregion
results are used to capture patterns occurring within individual clusters of reefs. Results
of all analyses at all clustering scales can be found at \[**insert citation for
repository**\] for those interested.

Reefs in each timeseries cluster were compared to identify characteristics that differ
between low, medium and high coral cover clusters. These characteristics include reef median
depth, mean timeseries DHW, mean timeseries DHW – tolerance level, Pearson’s correlation
between total coral cover and inversed DHW timeseries, proportion of coral habitable area
occupied by corals in the first timestep, ratio of source-to-sink larval connectivity and
total strength of larval connections between reefs. To analyse the DHW - tolerance levels of
reefs, heritable DHW – tolerance values were tracked over timeseries in a timestep \* taxa
\* reef \* scenario matrix. The mean timeseries DHW - tolerance was calculated over the
first four scenarios for each GCM (four from 4096 scenarios per GCM) due to computational
restraints, and then used to calculate an overall mean DHW – tolerance value for each reef
under each GCM.

### Carbonate budget analysis

Using median coral cover timeseries for each reef we calculated the number of years each
reef maintains coral cover above a given percent threshold. The threshold represents the
level of live coral cover necessary to maintain a positive carbonate budget (denoted here as
$\beta_{0}$ to indicate the budget equilibrium). Greater number of years above $\beta_{0}$
therefore suggests greater resilience and opportunity for recovery.

Recent analyses suggest a general threshold of \~17% live coral cover in the case of the GBR
[@desbiens2021]. Given in situ carbonate budgets are influenced by (1) a range of processes;
(2) the variety of approaches that could be used to measure those processes; and (3) the
uncertainty surrounding these, it would be unreasonable to assume all reefs adhere to a
single precise $\beta_{0}$ value. Concurrently, it is difficult to ascertain a suitable
$\beta_{0}$ value for each individual reef.

Given the uncertainties present, the proportion of modelled reefs that display capacity to
maintain coral cover above a given $\beta_{0}$ threshold is examined. An indicative range of
10 to 20% is used (inclusive, with a step size of 1%). The range was informed by Perry et
al., [-@perry2015] and Desbians et al., [-@desbiens2021] providing plausible indications of
the lower and upper bounds respectively. Robustness of the conclusions drawn to the
uncertainty in the precise value of $\beta_{0}$ for all reefs can then be assessed by using
the indicative range.

The relationship between the number of years above $\beta_{0}$ and median reef depth was
then assessed with Spearman's rank correlation. Spearman's correlation coefficient was
adopted as reef depth and connectivity strength distributions are expected to be non-normal
and highly skewed. Furthermore, reefs are naturally of different types and experience
different conditions, and so the monotonic trends (whether the relationship consistently
increase or decrease) rather than the exact quantative relationship was of interest for this
analysis.

### Connectivity modelling

\*\* need information on GBR1 connectivity used \*\*

Connectivity data from 24 days in total were used in this investigation. These data span six
years: 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 are each represented by 3 daily connectivity matrices,
while 2017 and 2020 are each represented by 5 daily matrices. Indicative connectivity
strengths are implemented in ADRIA-CoralBlox as the mean of all available data for each
location (i.e., all 24 days). While the connectivity strengths do not vary from year to year
within the simulation, they do vary between reefs of varying sizes, providing sufficient
heterogeneity to capture spatial patterns in larval dispersal and settlement dynamics. The
spatial variability also enables investigations into the influence of connectivity strength
and its role in driving recovery processes.

# Results

## Reef carbonate budget

As one might expect, the number of years experience cover above $\beta_{0}$ (the assumed
positive carbonate budget threshold) substantially decreases as $\beta_{0}$ increases. The
distribution of number of years above carbonate-cover thresholds is right-skewed, with many
reefs experiencing low numbers of years above thresholds.

Reefs with greater median depth levels maintain coral cover above indicative carbonate
budget levels for a longer time frame compared to reefs with shallower median depths
[@fig-access-esm1-5-depth-carbonate]. Reef median depth has a moderate positive correlation
with the number of years a reef maintains coral cover above the required threshold
[@fig-access-esm1-5-depth-carbonate]. Depth - carbonate budget maintainence correlation
decreases as $\beta_{0}$ increases. This is likely due to an increasing number of reefs
being unable to maintain coral cover above threshold levels as the threshold increases, with
values becoming increasingly right-skewed. The natural log of total connectivity strength
was found to have no correlation with the number of years a reef maintains cover above the
required thresholds [@sfig-access-esm1-5-conn-carbonate]. Log connectivity strength -
carbonate budget maintainence correlation slightly decreases as the required carbonate
budget threshold increases.

## Reef trajectories across futures

Each Global Climate Model (GCM) shows similar relationships between reef clusters and
contextual analysis factors, thus further comparisons of these clusters for each analysis
factor are only shown for ACCESS-ESM1-5 (an intermediate Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity
scenario [@sfig-ecs]). Results for the additional GCMs can be found at \[**BG: Insert
repository citation.**\]. However, there are substantial differences in the longevity of
reef resilience and maintenance of coral cover post 2030 between the GCMs, thus coral cover
timeseries are displayed for each GCM (displayed clustered at management-area scale to
preserve coarse spatial differences in cover trajectories) (@fig-gcm-cover-trajectories).

NorESM2-MM has the lowest Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (2.5°C) and reefs exhibit
continuing recovery and decline dynamics up to 2075 under this possible climate future.
Recovery phases are predominantly seen in the ‘high’ cover cluster. The ‘medium’ cluster,
and to a lesser degree the ‘low’ cluster, also exhibit periods of recovery and increasing
proportions of coral cover up to 2045. Under NorESM2-MM the Far Northern management area has
lower CID distances between low and high cover clusters than in other management areas
[@tbl-cluster-cid], this is reflected in the low degree of cover maintainence
[@fig-gcm-cover-trajectories]. ACCESS-ESM1-5 has an intermediate ECS value of 3.87°C which
results in intermediate levels of coral cover maintenance (between those of lower and higher
ECS GCMs) [@fig-gcm-cover-trajectories], reflected in intermediate CID distance values
within most management areas [@tbl-cluster-cid]. In Townsville-Whitsunday and Far Northern
management areas, reefs in the high cluster are able to maintain coral cover levels around
20% to 2050 under ACCESS-ESM1-5. Under ACCESS-CM2 (4.66K), EC-Earth3-Veg (4.30K) and
GFDL-CM4 (4.1K) GCMs cover trajectories are largely declining in all management areas,
reflected in lower CID distance values than other GCMs [@tbl-cluster-cid].

Under each GCM, in all management areas, low, medium and high cluster reefs have low levels
of distinction between DHW trajectories (@sfig-gcm-dhw-trajectories). The highest peak DHW
levels occur under GFDL-CM4 between 2045 and 2050, while greater increases in overall DHWs
timeseries occur under ACCESS-CM2 [@fig-methods-dhws].

intermediate median area-relative cover between 2030 and 2040 within each bioregion. ‘High’
clusters (blue) are clusters with the highest median area-relative cover between 2030 and
2040 within each bioregion. Solid lines represent the cluster median timeseries and bands

times (for each GCM), with each GCM displayed
horizontally.](../outputs/ADRIA_results/HighResCoralStress/figs/GCM_cover_timeseries_plot.png){#fig-gcm-cover-trajectories
fig-align="center" width="14.82cm"}

Comparing across GCMs, it is common for reefs to switch cluster level, including from low to
high and high to low cluster transitions (@sfig-gcm-bioregion-cluster-assignment). Of 2429
reefs, 20% (503) of reefs have consistent management area scale cluster assignment across

area, with 7, 13 and 31% occurring in the Cairns/Cooktown, Townsville/Whitsunday and
Mackay/Capricorn management areas respectively [@sfig-gcm-cluster-map]. Of the 503
consistently assigned reefs, 32, 7 and 61% are clustered into low, medium and high clusters
respectively. High assignment variability across GCMs is expected as spatial differences in
GCM DHW timeseries result in reefs being impacted at different relative magnitudes within
their management area across GCMs.

## Bioregion scale clustering

Across many bioregions timeseries clustering identified a ‘low’ cluster containing reefs
that suffer larger declines and generally have lower levels of coral cover than the other
clusters, a ‘medium’ cluster with intermediate levels of coral cover, and a ‘high’ cluster
with greater levels of cover recovery, with persistence to 2050 in some bioregions
(@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-timeseries).

In many bioregions, median reef depth decreases as cluster coral cover decreases, with reefs
within the ‘high’ cluster commonly having the greatest median reef depths within the
bioregion (@fig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-depth).

In many bioregions reefs in the 'low' cover cluster have the lowest cover - DHW timeseries
correlation levels, while reefs in 'high' clusters have the highest correlation levels
(@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-dhwcor).

Conversely, there are no consistent patterns across bioregions in reef area-relative cover
and mean timeseries DHW levels, with clusters having similar mean DHW levels in many
bioregions (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-dhwmean).

Similarly, there are no substantial differences between reef clusters in mean thermal
tolerance levels (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-dhwtol).

There are no consistent differences across bioregions and GCMs between clusters in their
reefs' initial proportion of habitable area occupied by corals
(@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-initialproportion).

Across most bioregions there are not consistent differences between clusters in connectivity
metrics such as source-to-sink connectivity ratio (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-logsosi)
and total connectivity strength (@sfig-access-esm1-5-bioregion-totalconnectivity).

# Discussion

Under all GCMs many reefs are projected to suffer substantial declines in coral cover
relative to 2025 levels, with an average of 38% of reefs (924 reefs) clustered into the
lowest cover level cluster at the management area scale across GCMs. NorESM2-MM and
ACCESS-ESM1-5 GCMs convey the most coral cover maintenance into the future. Differences
between low, medium and high reef clusters in cover timeseries are most notable under these
two GCMs [@tbl-cluster-cid; @fig-gcm-cover-trajectories]. Maintainance of coral cover into
the future is linked to the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity of the GCM used as levels of
future recovery and timespan of cover maintainance increase as GCM ECS increases
[@fig-gcm-cover-trajectories]. Under high-ECS GCMs (GFDL-CM4, EC-Earth3-Veg and ACCESS-CM2)
large declines and lower rates of recovery in high cover clusters are common compared to
lower-ECS GCMs.

The large differences in cover timeseries seen across the GCMs suggest that it is important
to consider uncertainty in future conditions when assessing possible biological responses to
change. This is supported by recent literature suggesting an effective approach to capturing
climate change uncertainty is to model responses using GCMs separately [@shepherd2018].
Despite large differences in coral cover across GCMs, the patterns identified between low,
medium and high clusters of reefs suggest that the relative importance of environmental and
biological factors such as depth refugia, connectivity and surface DHW levels is consistent
across scenarios.

Reefs in different clusters largely do not differ in mean modelled DHW levels experienced,
and exhibit overall similar DHW timeseries. While these reefs experience similar magnitude
DHWs based on SST, the proportion of the reefs' coral population impacted by heat stress
events depends on reef depth. Our results suggest that within shallow-water reef ecosystems
(non-mesophotic, depth \< 30m), depth contributes greatly to reef resilience and the ability
of the reef to maintain positive carbonate budgets under future conditions. While similar
findings have been demonstrated in the eastern Pacific [@smith2014], depth refugia analyses
have often focussed on the potential of mesophotic reefs (\> 30m deep) as thermal refugia
[@bongaerts2010; @holstein2015; @semmler2017]. In contrast, Venegas et al. [-@venegas2019]
found no association between depth and the alleviation of heat stress across a range of
shallow reefs in the Pacific. Reefs at shallow depths experience no, or few, years with
coral cover exceeding levels likely required to maintain positive carbonate budgets.
Movement of shallow reefs towards negative carbonate budgets in the future may contribute to
phase shifts in reef dominant CaCO~3~ production. Shifting from coral driven to encrusting
algae driven production, or to bioerosion dominated systems with rapid erosion of physical
reef frameworks [@dudgeon2010; @perry2008]. While reefs at increased depths may be able to
maintain coral driven CaCO~3~ production and accumulation into the future for longer.

These findings support the hypothesis that reefs at greater depths will exhibit
characteristics of refugia and more prolonged structural resilience under climate change
compared to shallower reefs. Additionally, Lui, Callaghan and Baldock [-@liu2024] suggest
that rubble instability is inversely correlated with reef depth, possibly limiting the
juvenile recruitment capacity of shallow reefs. A caveat to these depth-resilience findings
is the quality of the bathymetry data used to calculate median reef depth. As detailed
previously, estimates of median reef depth are derived from satellite imagery (at $10m^2$
resolution) which can be subject to high degrees of uncertainty, both in terms of the
estimated depth at for each pixel as well as their alignment to the established GBRMPA reef
outlines.

Current reef restoration and intervention-investigation efforts on the GBR, such as
deployment of coral seeding and fragment devices, target reefs with suitable restoration
sites in the 1-10m depth range [@howlett2021; @randall2021; @whitman2024]. One of the main
constraints on deployment depth is visual identification of target sites from the surface
for deployment and ongoing monitoring, in combination with factors such as deployment method
and tourism return value. Our results suggest that of the assessed reefs ocurring within the
1-10m depth range (1736 reefs), 62% (1082) of reefs fall into the low and medium clusters
(across all GCMs at the GBRMPA management region scale), with many unable to maintain
positive carbonate budgets under future conditions. Reef intervention planning is a complex
and challenging decision making process [@anthony2020], and our results suggest that
deployment site depth is an important factor to consider when assessing the long-term
resilience of deployment sites.

Our findings suggest that reefs in ‘high’ cover clusters do not have greater thermal
tolerance than reefs in lower coral cover clusters. This is in contrast with literature
suggesting corals have the capacity to adapt to increasing climate change pressures
[@humanes2022; @lachs2024], including the investigation by Bairos-Novak et al.
[-@bairos-novak2021] that revealed high heritability of bleaching and survival response
traits, used to inform thermal tolerance trait distributions in this investigation. The low
importance of thermal tolerance on cover outcomes may be due to reefs experiencing high
levels of thermal stress early in projected timeseries. High - early timeseries thermal
stress events may prevent the intergenerational adaptation of corals to thermal stress and
prevent thermal tolerance from reaching levels greater than 9°C-weeks. **\[TI note: This
paragraph needs to be revisited\]**

It is a common conclusion in coral reef ecology that a primary facet of reef resilience is
the degree of larval connectivity between reefs and the supply of recruits that a reef
receives following disturbance [@hock2017; @mumby2008; @torres2024]. In contrast, our
results suggest that there are few differences between resilient and non-resilient reefs in
connectivity metrics such as the ratio of outgoing to incoming larval connectivity and total
connectivity strength. Furthermore, our results suggest no relationship between connectivity
and the ability of reefs to maintain positive carbonate budgets under future conditions.
There has been contrasting evidence [@bode2018; @hock2017] surrounding whether recent
generation connectivity modelling is able to identify reefs that are important for recovery
processes, with findings dependent on the larval connectivity model used. These
investigations were performed using prior generations of larval connectivity models
parameterised for 2008-2013 [@hock2017] and 1996-2002 [@bode2018] time periods. Using
updated 1km^2^ resolution larval connectivity across the whole GBR, with a limited temporal
sample of particle flows, our results suggest that larval connectivity alone is not as
important for reef resilience and recovery as environmental refugia such as depth.

Our findings on the importance of connectivity may differ due to the highly uncertain nature
of larval connectivity modelling [@vogt-vincent2023], the way larval flows and juvenile
recruitment are implemented in ADRIA - CoralBlox, and the magnitude of early bleaching
events decreasing the breeding capacity of strongly connected reefs. Analysing daily
connectivity data Vogt-Vincent et al. [-@vogt-vincent2023] suggest that time-mean
connectivity may not be suitable for capturing the seasonal - ecological time scale
connectivity between locations due to high daily variability in connectivity data. This is
supported by the connectivity data used in our investigation, which have large relative
standard deviations for connectivity between reefs over the 24 days used
[@sfig-connectivity-rsd]. Using alternative summarisation methods that capture
ecological-timescale patterns in coral larval dispersal, such as cumulated implicit
connectivity [@vogt-vincent2023], future investigations may find increased importance of
both depth and reef connectivity for resilience, in line with other investigations
[@hock2017; @torres2024]. Further improvements and research in connectivity modelling are
necessary to provide a robust comparison of all factors influencing reef resilience.

## Limitations

There are multiple caveats in how coral ecosystem dynamics are modelled in this
investigation. We model coral colonies as circular diameter values and track these diameters
over timesteps through growth. Due to the availability of quality future projected data we
do not consider the impacts of waves, cyclones, currents and Crown of Thorns Starfish (CoTS)
on coral colony survival and bleaching [@massel1993; @deaker2022]. Uncertainty in
connectivity modelling outputs, satellite-derived bathymetry data and future thermal stress
projections are likely to influence the results obtained in this investigation.
Incorporating further improvements in connectivity modelling and understanding of the
influence of climate change on reef connectivity would improve the comparison of
connectivity as an important factor for reef resilience. The DHW data used in this
investigation have not been bias corrected for the Great Barrier Reef region and are part of
a wider Australian dataset [@dixon2022] developed using statistical downscaling. We
investigate a range of future climate responses, thermal projections and ecological
parameterisations of ADRIA - CoralBlox to account for many possible futures, and our results
suggest the factors that influence reef resilience are consistent across these scenarios.

Additionally, it is currently not possible to obtain highly accurate and precise estimates
of reef depth at the GBR-scale. Data adopted for the given assessment are said to be
accurate up to 15m from Mean Sea Level [@GBRMPA2020], however there are many sources of
uncertainty in the depth estimates used for this study. Satellite-derived estimates are
subject to different bottom types (rock, sand, seagrass, etc) and how these affect
reflectance, the water penetration depth of satellite sensors, influence of local conditions
(e.g., turbidity and wave activity), among many other factors. The median depths for each
indicative reef area were extracted from bathymetry data using zonal statistics and depth
values beyond the stated 15m accuracy threshold [@GBRMPA2020] were included. The resulting
depth estimates are therefore highly uncertain and are only adopted as a useful indication
for the purpose of the presented analysis. They are not intended to be an accurate and
precise report of reef depths across the GBR.

In addition to the usual challenges of deriving data from satellite imagery, it is
acknowledged that there is high potential for misalignment between the bathymetry data and
GBRMPA reef outlines. Hammerton and Lawrey [-@hammerton], for example, identified 120 false
positives, where features identified as reefs were in actuality sand banks or rocky reefs
(rather than coral reefs). Reefs with bathymetry data of less than 5% of its indicative area
were excluded from analysis to ensure analyses were not conducted on reefs with no data
coverage (see @sfig-depth-cutoff). The existing GBRMPA reef outlines were adopted to align
with other ongoing modelling and analyses conducted as part of the Reef Restoration and
Adaptation Program \[RRAP; <https://gbrrestoration.org>\] **\[TODO: PROPER CITATION OF
RRAP\]**.

The modelling conducted with ADRIA-CoralBlox itself is subject to many uncertainties. For
one, a formal mechanistic and spatial validation of the model represents an area for future
refinement, and is the focus of a future publication. Indicative results are included in the
supplementary **\[TI: For Pedro to include! :`D`\].** The consistency of projected patterns
with known coral-climate relationships and reef characteristics provides confidence in the
model's ability to meaningfully capture ecological signals at the GBR-scale. The mechanistic
basis of the model, combined with qualitative assessment of model behavior, supports the
robustness of our findings for understanding broad-scale coral cover responses to climatic
drivers. The aim here, however, was to assess the relative influence of reef characteristics
on structural resilience under future conditions, rather than provide spatially explicit and
highly accurate and precise predictions of reef outcomes. Using this approach we suggest
that reef depths is an important factor for reef resilience under thermal stress.

Improvements in remote sensing approaches for broad scale bathymetry measurement, and
understanding of how depth impacts experienced thermal stress on reefs will further enhance
investigations of depth as a critical factor for reef resilience. Additional analyses could
build on the findings of this study by assessing the impacts of prioritising reef depth in
reef restoration decision making. Future analyses could incorporate further environmental
and ecological stressors such as wave activity, ocean acidification, and Crown-of-Thorn
Starfish [@lin2023; @mcclanahan2005; @grimaldi2023; @grimaldi2022; @liu2024; @eyre2018].

# Conclusion

The results presented herein suggest that when modelled as part of a large and complex
ecosystem, reef depth is a key factor contributing to ongoing reef resilience. We provide
evidence in support of depth as a form of thermal refugia for shallow-water reefs on the
GBR. While protecting ‘key node’ reefs in larval connectivity networks is an important
consideration for reef restoration efforts [@anthony2020; @hock2017], our results suggest
that current connectivity modelling methods are not able to generate connectivity that
contributes to reef resilience under projected conditions **\[TI: TO BE REVISITED\]**. We
suggest further analyses that investigate the benefits of incorporating depth-based
resilience into reef decision making, as well as further research and development in
connectivity modelling methods for whole-ecosystem scales.

## ADRIA-CoralBlox

CoralBlox model incorporates linear extension (growth) and background mortality rates that
are dependent on the size and functional group of a coral colony. Environmental disturbances
and reproduction are not directly considered within CoralBlox. Instead, these factors are
considered by making changes to the distribution of colonies within CoralBlox timesteps
using the ADRIA (Adaptive Dynamic Reef Intervention Algorithms) platform [@iwanaga2023].
Within ADRIA, we incorporate coral life history and environmental events in the following
order: coral colony growth; coral reproduction; larval connectivity and settlement; and
coral bleaching due to heat stress. As ADRIA and CoralBlox are coupled together to represent
the system, we refer to both as ADRIA-CoralBlox.

Coral fecundity rates are dependent on colony size and functional group following the
results of Hall & Hughes [-@hall1996]. Coral fertilization rates are not considered within
this model, however larval survival and viability are incorporated in connectivity modelling
(see Connectivity modelling). Viable larvae settle at a reef location and are incorporated
into the model as the smallest size class but are not directly impacted by modelled
bleaching mortality. There has been contrasting evidence for juvenile corals being immune to
thermal bleaching events [@depczynski2013], we assume the high background mortality of
juveniles includes thermal stress [@álvarez-noriega2018].

### Scenario generation

Scenarios were sampled from the range of environmental and ecological factors using the
low-discrepancy Sobol' sampling method [@sobol1967; @sobol1993] with Owen scrambling
[@owen1995]. A base of 2 and padding of 32 is used for the Owen scrambling. Ecological
factors were sampled using a +/- 10% range relative to their nominal (assumed best guess)
value.

### Model parameterisation

CoralBlox uses user-defined size classes that influence size-dependent growth and mortality
rates, through which the coral colonies progress as they grow in diameter. Within ADRIA, we
define the distributions of these parameters, and the size classes based on ecological
monitoring data from the Ecological Intelligence for Reef Restoration Program (EcoRRAP)
([@australianinstituteofmarinescience2025; @ribeirodealmeida2024]).

**Bleaching mortality**

In ADRIA we track the thermal tolerance of each functional group and size class as a
truncated normal distribution that is updated in each timestep following growth and
recruitment. This distribution determines the proportion of the population on a reef that is
susceptible to bleaching (i.e. has a thermal threshold below the experienced DHW value).
Starting distributions for thermal tolerance levels are informed by Bairos-Novak et al.
[-@bairos-novak2021].
